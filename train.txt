Here are two reasons companies fail: they only do more of the same, or they only do what's new
To me the real, real solution to quality growth is figuring out the balance between two activities: exploration and exploitation
 Both are necessary, but it can be too much of a good thing
Consider Facit
 I'm actually old enough to remember them
 Facit was a fantastic company
 Everybody used them
 And what did Facit do when the electronic calculator came along? They continued doing exactly the same
 In six months, they went from maximum revenue 
 and they were gone
 Gone
To me, the irony about the Facit story is hearing about the Facit engineers, who had bought cheap, small electronic calculators in Japan that they used to double-check their calculators
Facit did too much exploitation
 But exploration can go wild, too
 Let's call them OncoSearch
 The company was brilliant
 They had applications that promised to diagnose, even cure, certain forms of blood cancer
 They were extremely innovative, and the mantra was, "When we only get it right," or even, "We want it perfect
" The sad thing is, before they became perfect -- even good enough -- they became obsolete
 OncoSearch did too much exploration
 And to me the power of the idea is its practicality
Exploration
 Exploration is about coming up with what's new
 It's about search, it's about discovery, it's about new products, it's about new innovations
 It's about changing our frontiers
 Our heroes are people who have done exploration: Madame Curie, Picasso, Neil Armstrong, Sir Edmund Hillary, etc
 We all know that exploration is risky
 We don't know the answers, we don't know if we're going to find them, and we know that the risks are high
Exploitation is the opposite
 Exploitation is taking the knowledge we have and making good, better
 Exploitation is about making our trains run on time
 It's about making good products faster and cheaper
 Exploitation is not risky -- in the short term
 But if we only exploit, it's very risky in the long term
 And I think we all have memories of the famous pop groups who keep singing the same songs again and again, until they become obsolete or even pathetic
So if we take a long-term perspective, we explore
 Small children, they explore all day
 All day it's about exploration
 As we grow older, we explore less because we have more knowledge to exploit on
 The same goes for companies
 Companies become, by nature, less innovative as they become more competent
And this is, of course, a big worry to CEOs
 And I hear very often questions phrased in different ways
 For example, "How can I both effectively run and reinvent my company?" Or, "How can I make sure that our company changes before we become obsolete or are hit by a crisis?" So, doing one well is difficult
 Doing both well as the same time is art -- pushing both exploration and exploitation
So one thing we've found is only about two percent of companies are able to effectively explore and exploit at the same time, in parallel
 But when they do, the payoffs are huge
 We have Nestlé creating Nespresso, we have Lego going into animated films, Toyota creating the hybrids, Unilever pushing into sustainability -- there are lots of examples, and the benefits are huge
 So I'll talk about two, but there are many
So let's talk about the perpetual search trap
 We discover something, but we don't have the patience or the persistence to get at it and make it work
 So instead of staying with it, we create something new
 But the same goes for that, then we're in the vicious circle of actually coming up with ideas but being frustrated
 OncoSearch was a good example
 A famous example is, of course, Xerox
 We see this in the public sector as well
 We all know that any kind of effective reform of education, research, health care, even defense, takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work
 But still, we change much more often
 We really don't give them the chance
 Facit fell into the success trap
 They literally held the future in their hands, but they couldn't see it
 They were simply so good at making what they loved doing, that they wouldn't change
 We are like that, too
 When we know something well, it's difficult to change
 Bill Gates has said: "Success is a lousy teacher
 It seduces us into thinking we cannot fail
" That's the challenge with success
So I think there are some lessons, and I think they apply to us
 The first lesson is: get ahead of the crisis
 And any company that's able to innovate is actually able to also buy an insurance in the future
 Netflix -- they could so easily have been content with earlier generations of distribution, but they always -- and I think they will always -- keep pushing for the next battle
"
 I'll share a chart with you, and I think it's a wonderful one
 Any company we look at, taking a one-year perspective and looking at the valuation of the company, innovation typically accounts for only about 30 percent
 So when we think one year, innovation isn't really that important
 But companies can't choose
 invite talent
 I don't think it's possible for any of us to be able to balance exploration and exploitation by ourselves
 I think it's a team sport
 I think we need to allow challenging
 I think the mark of a great company is being open to be challenged, and the mark of a good corporate board is to constructively challenge
 I think that's also what good parenting is about
 Maybe it's useful to think back at the old triumph marches in Rome, when the generals, after a big victory, were given their celebration
 Riding into Rome on the carriage, they always had a companion whispering in their ear, "Remember, you're only human
"
So I hope I made the point: balancing exploration and exploitation has a huge payoff
 But it's difficult, and we need to be conscious
I want to just point out two questions that I think are useful
 First question is, looking at your own company: In which areas do you see that the company is at the risk of falling into success traps, of just going on autopilot? And what can you do to challenge?
So let me leave you with this
 Whether you're an explorer by nature or whether you tend to exploit what you already know, don't forget: the beauty is in the balance
Thank you
So there are lands few and far between on Earth itself that are hospitable to humans by any measure, but survive we have
 And as the descendants of these explorers, we have their nomadic blood coursing through our own veins
 While Mars and all the movies made in its name have reinvigorated the ethos for space travel, few of us seem to truly realize that our species' fragile constitution is woefully unprepared for long duration journeys into space
 So just a quick show of hands here: how many of you think you would be able to survive in this lush wilderness for a few days? Well, that's a lot of you
 How about a few weeks? That's a decent amount
 Now, let us imagine that this local national forest experiences an eternal winter
 Same questions: how many of you think you would be able to survive for a few days? That's quite a lot
 How about a few weeks? So for a fun twist, let us imagine that the only source of water available is trapped as frozen blocks miles below the surface
 Soil nutrients are so minimal that no vegetation can be found, and of course hardly any atmosphere exists to speak of
Such examples are only a few of the many challenges we would face on a planet like Mars
 So how do we steel ourselves for voyages whose destinations are so far removed from a tropical vacation? Will we continuously ship supplies from Planet Earth? Build space elevators, or impossible miles of transport belts that tether your planet of choice to our home planet? And how do we grow things like food that grew up on Earth like us?
But I'm getting ahead of myself
 In our species' journey to find a new home under a new sun, we are more likely than not going to be spending much time in the journey itself, in space, on a ship, a hermetic flying can, possibly for many generations
The longest continuous amount of time that any human has spent in space is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months
 From astronauts' experiences in space, we know that spending time in a microgravity environment means bone loss, muscle atrophy, cardiovascular problems, among many other complications that range for the physiological to the psychological
In short, our cosmic voyages will be fraught with dangers both known and unknown
 It requires fairly little to maintain, offers much flexibility in design and only asks to be carried in a single plastic tube
The field of study that has enabled us to utilize the capabilities of the microbe is known as synthetic biology
 It comes from molecular biology, which has given us antibiotics, vaccines and better ways to observe the physiological nuances of the human body
 Using the tools of synthetic biology, we can now edit the genes of nearly any organism, microscopic or not, with incredible speed and fidelity
 Given the limitations of our man-made machines, synthetic biology will be a means for us to engineer not only our food, our fuel and our environment, but also ourselves to compensate for our physical inadequacies and to ensure our survival in space
To give you an example of how we can use synthetic biology for space exploration, let us return to the Mars environment
 The Martian soil composition is similar to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash, with trace amounts of organic material
 Let's say, hypothetically, what if martian soil could actually support plant growth without using Earth-derived nutrients? The first question we should probably ask is, how would we make our plants cold-tolerant? Because, on average, the temperature on Mars is a very uninviting negative 60 degrees centigrade
 The next question we should ask is, how do we make our plants drought-tolerant? Considering that most of the water that forms as frost evaporates more quickly than I can say the word "evaporate
" Well, it turns out we've already done things like this
 By borrowing genes for anti-freeze protein from fish and genes for drought tolerance from other plants like rice and then stitching them into the plants that need them, we now have plants that can tolerate most droughts and freezes
 Nature does stuff like this already, without our help
 We have simply found more precise ways to do it
So why would we want to change the genetic makeup of plants for space? Well, to not do so would mean needing to engineer endless acres of land on an entirely new planet by releasing trillions of gallons of atmospheric gasses and then constructing a giant glass dome to contain it all
 It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise that quickly becomes a high-cost cargo transport mission
 One of the best ways to ensure that we will have the food supplies and the air that we need is to bring with us organisms that have been engineered to adapt to new and harsh environments
 In essence, using engineered organisms to help us terraform a planet both in the short and long term
So we can use synthetic biology to bring highly engineered plants with us, but what else can we do? Well, I mentioned earlier that we, as a species, were evolved uniquely for planet Earth
 That fact has not changed much in the last five minutes that you were sitting here and I was standing there
 And so, if we were to dump any of us on Mars right this minute, even given ample food, water, air and a suit, we are likely to experience very unpleasant health problems from the amount of ionizing radiation that bombards the surface of planets like Mars that have little or nonexistent atmosphere
 Unless we plan to stay holed up underground for the duration of our stay on every new planet, we must find better ways of protecting ourselves without needing to resort to wearing a suit of armor that weighs something equal to your own body weight, or needing to hide behind a wall of lead
So let us appeal to nature for inspiration
 Among the plethora of life here on Earth, there's a subset of organisms known as extremophiles, or lovers of extreme living conditions, if you'll remember from high school biology
 And among these organisms is a bacterium by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans
 It is known to be able to withstand cold, dehydration, vacuum, acid, and, most notably, radiation
 While its radiation tolerance mechanisms are known, we have yet to adapt the relevant genes to mammals
 There are many facets that go into its radiation tolerance, and it's not as simple as transferring one gene
 But given a little bit of human ingenuity and a little bit of time, I think to do so is not very hard either
 Even if we borrow just a fraction of its ability to tolerate radiation, it would be infinitely better than what we already have, which is just the melanin in our skin
 As difficult as it is to see, homo sapiens, that is humans, evolves every day, and still continues to evolve
 Thousands of years of human evolution has not only given us humans like Tibetans, who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions, but also Argentinians, who can ingest and metabolize arsenic, the chemical element that can kill the average human being
 Every day, the human body evolves by accidental mutations that equally accidentally allow certain humans to persevere in dismal situations
But, and this is a big but, such evolution requires two things that we may not always have, or be able to afford, and they are death and time
 In our species' struggle to find our place in the universe, we may not always have the time necessary for the natural evolution of extra functions for survival on non-Earth planets
 We're living in what E
O
 Augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how, but of when
Using synthetic biology to change the genetic makeup of any living organisms, especially our own, is not without its moral and ethical quandaries
 How do we use our knowledge to protect ourselves from the external dangers and then protect ourselves from ourselves?
I pose these questions not to engender the fear of science but to bring to light the many possibilities that science has afforded and continues to afford us
 We must coalesce as humans to discuss and embrace the solutions not only with caution but also with courage
Mars is a destination, but it will not be our last
 Our true final frontier is the line we must cross in deciding what we can and should make of our species' improbable intelligence
Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving
 Our path to the stars will be rife with trials that will bring us to question not only who we are but where we will be going
Thank you
 I've always been weirdly obsessed with advertising
 I remember watching Saturday morning cartoons, paying more attention to the commercials than to the shows, trying to figure out how they were trying to get inside my head
 Ultimately, that led me to my dream job
 I became a partner at a big New York ad agency
 Suddenly, my family was thrown into the middle of a nightmare, being told that my brother was going to die, actually being given the opportunity to say goodbye to him, then several emergency brain surgeries and now what's amounted, for Matt, to a lifetime spent courageously recovering from a traumatic brain injury
But as much as  -- yeah, deserves it --
But as much as this tragedy was a nightmare for my family, I often think about how much worse it could have been; in fact, how much worse it is for the 90 families every day who aren't as fortunate, who lose loved ones -- brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, parents
 They don't all make national headlines
 In fact, most of them don't
 They go largely unnoticed, in a nation that's kind of come to accept a disgraceful national epidemic as some kind of new normal
So I quit my job in advertising to try and do something about this disgraceful national epidemic, because I came to realize that the challenges to preventing gun violence are actually the same ones that made me love advertising, which is to try to figure out how to engage people
 Only instead of doing it to sell products, doing it to save lives
 And that comes down to finding common ground, where what I want overlaps with what you want
 And you might be surprised to learn, when it comes to gun violence, just how much common ground there is
Let's look, for example, at people who love to hunt, a sport enjoyed by millions across the US
 It's a proud tradition
 Families
 In some places, the first day of hunting season is actually a school holiday
 What do hunters want? Well, they want to hunt
 They love their guns
 They believe deeply in the Second Amendment right to own those guns
 But that doesn't mean there isn't common ground
In fact, there's a lot of it, starting with the basic idea of keeping guns out of dangerous hands
 This isn't about taking certain guns away from all people
 It's about keeping all guns away from certain people, and it's the people that, it turns out, we all agree shouldn't have guns: convicted violent criminals, domestic abusers, the dangerously mentally ill
 We can all appreciate how Brady background checks have been incredibly effective in keeping guns out of those dangerous hands
 In 20 years, Brady background checks at federally licensed firearm dealers have blocked 2
And whether you love guns or hate guns, you probably also appreciate that there shouldn't be thousands of gun sales every day at guns shows or online without those Brady background checks, just like there shouldn't be two lines to get on an airplane -- one with security and one with no security
And the numbers show the overwhelming agreement among the American public: 90 percent of Americans support expanding Brady background checks to all gun sales -- including 90 percent of Republicans, more than 80 percent of gun owners, more than 70 percent of NRA members
 This is not a controversial idea
 In fact, only six percent of the American public disagrees
 That's about the percentage of the American public that believes the moon landing was a fake
And it's also about the percentage that believes the government is putting mind-controlling technology in our TV broadcast signals
 Ten years ago, 42 percent of the American public believed -- incorrectly -- that a gun makes your home safer
 Today, that number is 63 percent
Why? I kind of hate to say it, because it gets to the dark underbelly of advertising, which is if you tell a big enough lie enough times, eventually that lie becomes the truth
 And that's exactly what's happened here
 The corporate gun lobby has spent billions of dollars blocking the CDC from doing research into the public health epidemic of gun violence; blocking pediatricians from talking to parents about the dangers of guns in the home; blocking smart-gun technology and other technology that would prevent kids from firing parents' guns and would save lives
 They're desperate to hide the truth, because they view the truth as a threat to their bottom line
 And a lot of those people are children
 Every day in the US, nine kids are just shot unintentionally
 900 children and teens take their own lives every year
 And here's the thing: they're almost all with a parent's gun
 Even two-thirds of school shootings happen with a gun taken from the home, including the terrible tragedy at Sandy Hook
 I meet so many of these parents; it's the most heartbreaking part of my job
 These are not bad people
 And the result is a nightmare -- not only for families like mine, but for, really, at the end of the day, all of us
But I'm not here to talk about the nightmare of gun violence
 I'm here to talk about our dream, and it's a dream we all share, which is the dream of a better, safer, future
 For my organization, for the Brady Campaign, that dream is reflected in the bold goal to cut the number of gun deaths in the US in half by 2025
 And I hope to leave all of you here tonight with a strong sense of exactly why that dream is so absolutely within reach
 Because folks, for every great movement around the world, there's a moment where you can look back and say, "That's when things really started to change
" And I'm here to say that for the movement to end gun violence in America, that moment is here
We are so clearly at a tipping point, because the American public has come together by the millions like never before, based on that common ground, to say, "Enough
" Enough of the mass shootings in malls and movie theaters and churches and schools
 Enough of the daily terror of gun violence in homes and streets that's claimed the lives of women and young black men in staggering proportions
 Enough of easy access to guns by the people that we all agree shouldn't have them
 And enough of a small group of craven politicians putting the interests of the corporate gun lobby ahead of the people they have been elected to represent
 Enough
And the really exciting thing is, it's not just the usual suspects like me that are saying it anymore
 It's so much bigger than that
 And if you want proof, let's start where most conversations in the US seem to start -- with Kim Kardashian
 it's not really a joke
 I mean, think about when issues change
 It's when they go from being political and advocacy issues to being part of pop culture, voices coming from everywhere, celebrities using their platforms, musicians, athletes
 The NBA has come forward
 Conservative pundits that you never would have imagined have come forward
 There's real cultural change -- I even hear there's a TED Talk about it this year
 That's the extent to which this cultural change is happening
 And yes, Kim Kardashian has made an unsolicited passionate appeal to her 35 million Twitter followers for expanded background checks
 This used to be the classic third-rail issue for Democrats
 Couldn't run from it fast enough
 Now candidates are running on it
 Some are being forced to reverse very bad positions they defended very comfortably, until very recently
 We're still outfunded, yes, by the corporate gun lobby, and ultimately that needs to change
 But you know what? We're smarter and we're scrappier, and we have the truth on our side
 And we're on offense
You know, they say that the Internet democratizes information
 Social media and some of the organizing tools that plug into it have democratized activism
 It's allowed us to show what 90 percent support really looks like
 It's enabled us to start to really close -- and this is the bottom line -- close that disgraceful disconnect between what the American public wants and what our elected leaders are doing about it
Until recently, the narrative in Congress was that calls from the other side, from that six percent, outnumbered calls from our side 10 to one
 We're flipping that narrative on its head
 After that recent terrible tragedy in San Bernardino, we jammed Congressional switchboards
 We put 15,000 calls into Congress in 24 hours
 And you know what? We got a vote on a bill that nobody thought was going to see the light of day anytime soon
 We're seeing real movement to repeal some of the most evil, ugly gun lobby legislation passed over the last dark decade
 The stranglehold of the gun lobby is clearly being broken
 We've seen President Obama's historic executive actions
 They don't go all the way, but they are going to save lives, because they expand Brady background checks to thousands of gun sales that didn't have them previously
 We're marching across the country, state by state, marriage-equality style
And you know what? We're winning
 Congress is almost always the last to wake up and realize that it's on the wrong side of history
 And when they do, it's always because the American public shakes them
 And that's exactly what we're doing right now, as we're in this tipping point
You know, recently I was flying cross-country to give a speech to a large group like this, although far less intimidating, and the woman sitting next to me happened to be binge-watching one of my all-time favorite TV shows, "Mad Men," a period TV show about advertising in the 1960s
 And as I was trying to think about how to end my remarks, I'd glance up at her screen every now and then, and it seemed that every time I did, I'd see somebody smoking in an office or around children or while pregnant or drinking and driving or driving without seat belts or sexually harassing a coworker
And ultimately it dawned on me: what tremendous inspiration to those of us who have this dream to end gun violence
 I mean, think about how much the world has changed in a relatively short period of time, how all those behaviors that were once considered commonplace or normal -- some even glamorous or sexy -- have become stigmatized in just a generation or two, once they became conversations about our common ground
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you
It has been 128 years since the last country in the world abolished slavery and 53 years since Martin Luther King pronounced his "I Have A Dream" speech
 But we still live in a world where the color of our skin not only gives a first impression, but a lasting one that remains
I was born in a family full of colors
 My father is the son of a maid from whom he inherited an intense dark chocolate tone
 He was adopted by those who I know as my grandparents
 The matriarch, my grandma, has a porcelain skin and cotton-like hair
 My grandpa was somewhere between a vanilla and strawberry yogurt tone, like my uncle and my cousin
 She has two sisters
 One in a toasted-peanut skin and the other, also adopted, more on the beige side, like a pancake
Growing up in this family, color was never important for me
 Outside home, however, things were different soon
 Color had many other meanings
I remember my first drawing lessons in school as a bunch of contradictory feelings
 It was exciting and creative but I never understood the unique flesh-colored pencil
 I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink
 My skin was brown, and people said I was black
Later, when I took my cousin to school, I was usually taken for the nanny
 I was even treated like a prostitute just because I was walking alone on the beach with European friends
 And many times, visiting my grandma or friends in upper class buildings, I was invited not to use the main elevator
 Because in the end, with this color and this hair, I cannot belong to some places
In some way, I get to used to it and accept part of it
 However, something inside of me keeps revolving and struggling
Years later I married a Spaniard
 But not any Spaniard
 I chose one with the skin color of a lobster when sunburnt
 What will be the color of your children? As you can understand, this is my last concern
 But thinking about it, with my previous background, my story led me to make my personal exercise as a photographer
 And that is how Humanae was born
Humanae is a pursuit to highlight our true colors, rather than the untrue white, red, black or yellow associated with race
 It's a kind of game to question our codes
 It's a work in progress from a personal story to a global history
 Then I choose an 11-pixel square from the nose, paint the background, and look for the corresponding color in the industrial palette, Pantone
I started with my family and friends, then more and more people joined the adventure, thanks to public calls coming through the social media
I thought that the main space to show my work was the Internet because I want an open concept that invites everybody to push the share button in both the computer and their brain
The snowball started to roll
 The project had a great welcome -- invitations, exhibitions, physical formats, galleries and museums 
 just happened
 And among them, my favorite: when Humanae occupies public spaces and appears in the street, it fosters a popular debate and creates a feeling of community
 Just to mention some of them -- from someone included in the Forbes list, to refugees who crossed the Mediterranean by boat
 In Paris, from the UNESCO Headquarters to a shelter
All kinds of beliefs, gender identities or physical impairments, a newborn or terminally ill
 We all together build Humanae
Those portraits make us rethink how we see each other
 When modern science is questioning the race concept, what does it mean for us to be black, white, yellow, red? Is it the eye, the nose, the mouth, the hair? Or does it have to do with our origin, nationality or bank account?
This personal exercise turned out to be a discovery
 Suddenly I realized that Humanae was useful for many people
 It represents a sort of mirror for those who cannot find themselves reflected in any label
It was amazing that people started to share their thoughts about the work with me
 I have hundreds of that, I will share with you, too
A mother of 11 years -- A mother of an 11-year-old girl wrote me, "Very good for me as a tool to work on her confidence, as this past weekend one of her girlfriends argued with her that she does not belong and should not be allowed to live in Norway
 So your work has a very special place in my heart and it's very important for me
"
 Perhaps we should stop
 Instead of framing, ask the individual, 'How would you label yourself?' Then I would say, 'Hi
 I'm a Dominican-Dutch, I grew up in a mixed family and I'm a bisexual woman
' "
Besides these unexpected and touching reactions, Humanae finds a new life in a different variety of fields
 It's a collection of faces
Researchers in the fields of anthropology, physics and neuroscience use Humanae with different scientific approaches related to human ethnicity, optophysiology, face recognition or Alzheimer's
One of the most important impacts of the project is that Humanae was chosen to be the cover of Foreign Affairs, one of the most relevant political publications
 And talking about foreign affairs, I found the perfect ambassadors for my project 
 teachers
 Their passion encourages me to go back to drawing classes, but this time as a teacher myself
My students, both adults and kids, paint their self-portraits, trying to discover their own unique color
As a photographer, I realize that I can be a channel for others to communicate
 As an individual, as Angélica, every time I take a picture, I feel that I am sitting in front of a therapist
 All the frustration, fear and loneliness that I once felt 
The last country -- the last country in the world who abolished slavery is the country where I was born, Brazil
 We still have to work hard to abolish discrimination
 That remains a common practice worldwide, and that will not disappear by itself
Thank you
Thank you
Thousands of years from now, we'll look back at the first century of computing as a fascinating but very peculiar time -- the only time in history where humans were reduced to live in 2D space, interacting with technology as if we were machines; a singular, 100-year period in the vastness of time where humans communicated, were entertained and managed their lives from behind a screen
Today, we spend most of our time tapping and looking at screens
 And it is this very limitation and my desire to connect with people that inspires me as a creator
 Put simply: I want to create a new reality, a reality where technology brings us infinitely closer to each other, a reality where people, not devices, are the center of everything
I dream of a reality where technology senses what we see, touch and feel; a reality where technology no longer gets in our way, but instead embraces who we are
 I dream of technology on a human path
 We have all experienced technology that enables people to act more like people, products that enable natural interactions, voice controls or biometrics
This is the next step in the evolution
 Devices like this will bring 3D holographic content right into our world, enhancing the way we experience life beyond our ordinary range of perceptions
 Now, I'm not thinking about a distant future
 I'm talking about today
 We are already seeing car companies like Volvo designing cars differently with HoloLens; universities like Case Western redefining the way medical students learn; and my personal favorite, NASA is using HoloLens to let scientists explore planets holographically
Now, this is important
 By bringing holograms into our world, I'm not just talking about a new device or a better computer
 I'm talking about freeing ourselves from the 2D confines of traditional computing
 temporally adjusted, we're like cave people in computer terms
 We've barely discovered charcoal and started drawing the first stick figures in our cave
 Now, this is the perspective I apply to my work every single day
 And now for the next few minutes, I invite all of you to apply the same perspective to the journey ahead of us
Now, as I put this HoloLens on, let me explain the setup a little bit
 Momentarily, I am going to be seeing holograms right on this stage, just as clearly as I can see all of you
 Now at the same time, we have also this special camera that just walked in onstage so that all of you can share in this experience with me up on all the monitors
So let's start our journey
 And what better place to begin our journey, than in the computer cave of 2D
 Let's explore the world all around us with this new lens, and understand the computer world from a brand new perspective
The computer universe is both marvelous and primitive
 It's a universe based on causality
 As developers, we dream the different causes and then we program the different effects
 Double click on an icon, that's a cause
 Open an application, that's an effect
 Now when we compare this to our physical universe, it is overly constraining, because our universe is not digital
 Our universe doesn't think in terms of zero or one, true or false, or black or white
 We exist in a world governed by quantum physics, a universe of zero and one both at the same time, a reality based on infinite probabilities and shades of gray
 You can see how these two worlds collide
So why are screens so pervasive in our analog life? We see screens from the moment we wake up, to the moment we fall asleep
 Why?
 Within the digital universe, we have the power to displace space and the power to displace time
 It doesn't matter if you're using technology for entertainment, productivity or communication
 Think of it this way: let's all go home tonight and watch our favorite show on television
 As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk, I'm going to immediately call my lovely family in Seattle
 Now, these are such great superpowers that we put up with the two-dimensional limitations of our current digital world
 It's remarkable to dream of this world, a world where technology truly understands us -- where we live, work and communicate -- with tools that enhance the human experience, not machines that limit our humanity
 It required sensing the world from the perspective of a machine
 If you're a machine trying to sense our world, how would you actually break the problem down? You'd probably try to classify things as a human, an environment or an object
 But how would that machine then interact with reality? And I can think of three ways
First, as a machine, I would observe or I would input reality
 Speech recognition and biometric authentication are great examples of a machine interacting with humans from an input perspective
 Secondly, as a machine, I could place digital information, or output information, into reality
 Holograms are examples of a machine interacting with an environment from an output perspective
 Finally, as a machine, I could exchange energy with the world via haptics
 Now here's a secret: as an engineer, I get really excited anytime I can reduce something to the matrix
 From self-driving cars to smartphones to this holographic computer on my head, machines are becoming capable of understanding our world
 And they are starting to interact with us in significantly more personal ways
Now, imagine having granular control over everything in the world
 Move the dial the other way, and you get virtual reality
 Now, imagine dialing your entire environment between virtual and real worlds
 I love it down here
 Now, imagine if I could look at all of you and dial from real humans into elves
 When technology truly understands our world, it will again transform the ways we interact, the ways we work and the ways we play
Less than half a century ago, two courageous men landed on the moon, using computers that were less powerful than the phones in your pockets
Now imagine how our children and their children will experience the continued exploration of space with technology that understands this world
 We already live in a world where real-time universal translators exist
 And I can squint, and I can already see holographic telepresence in our near future
 I invite you to experience, for the first time anywhere in the world, here on the TED stage, a real-life holographic teleportation, between me and my friend, Dr
 Jeffrey Norris, from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
Finger crossed
 Hi, Jeff
 Hey, Alex
 Phew! That worked
 How are you doing today, Jeff?
 Doing great
 So, can you tell us a little bit, Jeff, about where you are?
 I'm standing in a room across the street, while I'm standing on this stage with you, while I'm standing on Mars, a hundred million miles away
 Wow, a hundred million miles away
 This is crazy! Can you tell us a little bit more about where all this data from Mars is coming from?
 Absolutely
 Humans are natural explorers
 We can instantly understand an environment, just by being present in it
 We've built tools like our Mars Rover to extend our vision and lengthen our reach
 Now, we're leaping over all of that, over the giant antennas and the relay satellites and the vastness between worlds to take our first steps on this landscape as if we were truly there
But our dreams don't have to end with making it just like being there
 When we dial this real world to the virtual, we can do magical things
 We can see in invisible wavelengths or teleport to the top of a mountain
 Perhaps someday, we'll feel the minerals in a rock just by touching it
 We're taking the first steps
 But we want the whole world to join us in taking the next, because this is not a journey for a few, but for all of us
 Thank you so much for joining us on the TED stage today
 Thank you Alex, bye bye
 Bye, Jeff
I dream about this future every single day
 We used to live in tribes where we interacted, communicated and worked together
 We are all beginning to build technology that will enable us to return to the humanity that brought us where we are today -- technology that will let us stop living inside this 2D world of monitors and pixels, and let us start remembering what it feels like to live in our 3D world
 Thanks so much
 I have some questions
 OK
 And I'll just ask you straight, then we have a straight answer
 Talk about this field of view issue
 Is this type of experience what someone who buys the product will get?
 It's a great question, Or, said better, this is a question we've been receiving in the media for possibly the last year
 If you do your research, I haven't answered that question
 I've purposely ignored it, because ultimately, it's the wrong question to ask
 That's the equivalent of me showing holograms to someone for the first time, and you then saying, "What's the size of your television?" The field of view for the product is almost irrelevant
 What we should be talking about is the density of lights, or radiance, that shows up
 Better said, what the angular resolution is of the things that you see
 So even if I wanted to cheat, I can't
 But the camera has a different lens on it than our eye
 It's seeing a much wider view than the human eye is
 So if you think about the points of light that show up radially from the vision of the camera, which is the thing that matters: how many points of light can I get in a given volume? That's the same as I get on this HoloLens as I will on that one
 Now, this camera sees a much wider view of the world, right?
 Jesus Christ!
 He did show up! I told you he'd show up
 Come this way
 But the angular resolution of the holograms that you see, the points of light per unit of area, are actually the same
 So you spent -- Jeff, I'll get to you in a minute -- so you spent a lot of time mapping the stage --
 So help me out here: if I buy a HoloLens and have it at home, I don't need to map my apartment, right?
 The HoloLens maps in real time at about five frames per second, with this technology that we call spatial mapping
 So in your home, as soon as you put it on, holograms will start showing up, and you'll start placing them and they'll start learning your home
 In a stage environment where we're trying to get something on my head to communicate with something over there with all of the wireless connectivity that usually brings all conferences down, we don't take the risk of trying to do this live
 So what we do is pre-map the stage at five frames per second with the same spatial-mapping technology that you'll use with the product at home, and then we store it, so that when there's shenanigans of wireless in an environment like this, between the camera's HoloLens and the one on my head, we don't have things disappear
 Because ultimately, the holograms are coming from this HoloLens, and that one is just viewing the HoloLens
 So if I lose connectivity, you would stop seeing beautiful things on the screen
 And it was beautiful
 Um 
 Jeff?
 Yes?
 Hi
 I'll take a step back
 So Jeff, you were on Mars, you were here, you were in a room across the street
 Tell me more about the fact that, with holograms, you have sight but you don't have touch, you don't have smell
 Is this scientifically useful now? That's my question for a hologram
 Thanks for the question
 Absolutely, I believe that these technologies are scientifically useful right now, and that's why we're using them in multiple parts of our work at NASA
 We're also using it for our astronauts on the space station
 We're even using it now to design the next generation of our spacecraft
 Amazing
 OK, Jeff, please go away
 Thank you very much
Alex, really, that was amazing
 Thank you
 Thank you
 Thank you
It began with one question: If Africa was a bar, what would your country be drinking or doing? I kicked it off with a guess about South Africa, which wasn't exactly according to the rules because South Africa's not my country
And then I waited
 And then I had that funny feeling where I wondered if I crossed the line
 So, I sent out a few other tweets about my own country and a few other African countries I'm familiar with
 And then I waited again, but this time I read through almost every tweet I had ever tweeted to convince myself, no, to remind myself that I'm really funny and that if nobody gets it, that's fine
But luckily, I didn't have to do that for very long
 Very soon, people were participating
 In fact, by the end of that week in July, the hashtag #ifafricawasabar would have garnered around 60,000 tweets, lit up the continent and made its way to publications all over the world
People were using the hashtag to do many different things
 To poke fun at their stereotypes: [#IfAfricaWasABar Nigeria would be outside explaining that he will pay the entrance fee, all he needs is the bouncer's account details
]
To criticize government spending: [#ifafricawasabar South Africa would be ordering bottles it can't pronounce running a tab it won't be able to pay]
To make light of geopolitical tensions: [#IfAfricaWasABar South Sudan would be the new guy with serious anger management issues
]
To remind us that even in Africa there are some countries we don't know exist: [#IfAfricaWasABar Lesotho would be that person who nobody really knows but is always in the pictures
]
And also to make fun of the countries that don't think that they're in Africa: [#IfAfricaWasABar Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco be like "What the hell are we doing here?!!"]
But most importantly, people were using the hashtag to connect
 People were connecting over their Africanness
 So for one week in July, Twitter became a real African bar
 And I was really thrilled, mainly because I realized that Pan-Africanism could work, that we had before us, between us, at our fingertips a platform that just needed a small spark to light in us a hunger for each other
My name is Siyanda Mohutsiwa, I'm 22 years old and I am Pan-Africanist by birth
 Now, I say I'm Pan-Africanist by birth because my parents are from two different African countries
 My father's from a country called Botswana in southern Africa
 It's only slightly bigger than Germany
 This year we celebrate our 50th year of stable democracy
 And it has some very progressive social policies
 My mother's country is the Kingdom of Swaziland
 It's a very, very small country, also in southern Africa
 It is Africa's last complete monarchy
 So it's been ruled by a king and a royal family in line with their tradition, for a very long time
On paper, these countries seem very different
 And when I was a kid, I could see the difference
 It rained a lot in one country, it didn't rain quite as much in the other
 You see, I was born in one country and raised in the other
 So I was being introduced to my new home, my new cultural identity, as a complete outsider, incapable of comprehending anything that was being said to me by the family and country whose traditions I was meant to move forward
 But very soon, I would shed SiSwati
 And when I would go back to Swaziland, I would be constantly confronted by how very non-Swazi I was becoming
Add to that my entry into Africa's private school system, whose entire purpose is to beat the Africanness out of you, and I would have a very peculiar adolescence
 But I think that my interest in ideas of identity was born here, in the strange intersection of belonging to two places at once but not really belonging to either one very well and belonging to this vast space in between and around simultaneously
 I became obsessed with the idea of a shared African identity
Since then, I have continued to read about politics and geography and identity and what all those things mean
 I've also held on to a deep curiosity about African philosophies
 And when I thought, at 14, that I had digested these grand ideas, I moved on to the speeches of iconic African statesmen like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara and Congo's Patrice Lumumba
 I read every piece of African fiction that I could get my hands on
So when Twitter came, I hopped on with the enthusiasm of a teenage girl whose friends are super, super bored of hearing about all this random stuff
 So my generation, we were sending messages to each other on this platform that just needed 140 characters and a little bit of creativity
 On long commutes to work, in lectures that some of us should have been paying attention to, on our lunch breaks, we would communicate as much as we could about the everyday realities of being young and African
But of course, this luxury was not available to everybody
 So this meant that if you were a teenage girl in Botswana and you wanted to have fun on the Internet, one, you had to tweet in English
 Two, you had to follow more than just the three other people you knew online
 You had to follow South Africans, Zimbabweans, Ghanaians, Nigerians
 And suddenly, your whole world opened up
I followed vibrant Africans who were travelling around the continent, taking pictures of themselves and posting them under the hashtag #myafrica
 Because at that time, if you were to search Africa on Twitter or on Google or any kind of social media, you would think that the entire continent was just pictures of animals and white guys drinking cocktails in hotel resorts
But Africans were using this platform to take some kind of ownership of the tourism sectors
 It was Africans taking selfies on the beaches of Nigeria
And these were the same Africans that I began to meet in my own travels around the continent
 We would discuss African literature, politics, economic policy
 But almost invariably, every single time, we would end up discussing Twitter
 And that's when I realized what this was
 We were standing in the middle of something amazing, because for the first time ever young Africans could discuss the future of our continent in real time, without the restriction of borders, finances and watchful governments
Because the little known truth is many Africans know a lot less about other African countries than some Westerners might know about Africa as a whole
 This is by accident, but sometimes, it's by design
 For example, in apartheid South Africa, black South Africans were constantly being bombarded with this message that any country ruled by black people was destined for failure
 And this was done to convince them that they were much better off under crushing white rule than they were living in a black and free nation
 Add to that Africa's colonial, archaic education system, which has been unthinkingly carried over from the 1920s -- and at the age of 15, I could name all the various causes of the wars that had happened in Europe in the past 200 years, but I couldn't name the president of my neighboring country
 And to me, this doesn't make any sense because whether we like it or not, the fates of African people are deeply intertwined
When disaster hits, when turmoil hits, we share the consequences
 Africa has six of the world's largest refugee centers
 What was once a Burundian problem becomes an African problem
 So to me, there are no Sudanese problems or South African problems or Kenyan problems, only African problems because eventually, we share the turmoil
So if we share the problems, why aren't we doing a better job of sharing the successes? How can we do that? Well, in the long term, we can shoot towards increasing inter-African trade, removing borders and putting pressure on leaders to fulfill regional agreements they've already signed
 But I think that the biggest way for Africa to share its successes is to foster something I like to call social Pan-Africanism
Now, political Pan-Africanism already exists, so I'm not inventing anything totally new here
 And who does that benefit? Well, African leaders, almost exclusively
 No, what I'm talking about is the Pan-Africanism of the ordinary African
 Young Africans like me, we are bursting with creative energy, with innovative ideas
 But with bad governance and shaky institutions, all of this potential could go to waste
 And I think that thing is social Pan-Africanism
My dream is that young Africans stop allowing borders and circumstance to suffocate our innovation
 My dream is that when a young African comes up with something brilliant, they don't say, "Well, this wouldn't work in my country," and then give up
 My dream is that young Africans begin to realize that the entire continent is our canvas, is our home
 Using the Internet, we can begin to think collaboratively, we can begin to innovate together
 In Africa, we say, "If you want to go fast, you go alone, but if you want to go far, you go together
And this is already happening
 We now have a platform
 Before now, if you wanted to hear from the youth in Africa, you waited for the 65-year-old minister of youth --
to wake up in the morning, take his heartburn medication and then tell you the plans he has for your generation in 20 years time
 But now we have opportunities to back each other up in ways we never could before
We support South African students who are marching against ridiculously high tertiary fees
 We support Zimbabwean women who are marching to parliament
 We support Angolan journalists who are being illegally detained
 For the first time ever, African pain and African aspiration has the ability to be witnessed by those who can empathize with it the most: other Africans
I believe that with a social Pan-Africanist thinking and using the Internet as a tool, we can begin to rescue each other, and ultimately, to rescue ourselves
Thank you
So, this is a story about how we know what we know
It's a story about this woman, Natalia Rybczynski
 She's a paleobiologist, which means she specializes in digging up really old dead stuff
 Yeah, I had someone call me "Dr
"
 And I think she's particularly interesting because of where she digs that stuff up, way above the Arctic Circle in the remote Canadian tundra
Now, one summer day in 2006, she was at a dig site called the Fyles Leaf Bed, which is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic north pole
 Really, it's not going to sound very exciting, because it was a day of walking with your backpack and your GPS and notebook and just picking up anything that might be a fossil
 And at some point, she noticed something
 Rusty, kind of rust-colored, about the size of the palm of my hand
 It was just lying on the surface
 And at first she thought it was just a splinter of wood, because that's the sort of thing people had found at the Fyles Leaf Bed before -- prehistoric plant parts
 But that night, back at camp 
 
 I get out the hand lens, I'm looking a little bit more closely and realizing it doesn't quite look like this has tree rings
 Maybe it's a preservation thing, but it looks really like 
 bone
 So over the next four years, she went to that spot over and over, and eventually collected 30 fragments of that exact same bone, most of them really tiny
 It's not a whole lot
 It fits in a small Ziploc bag
 And she tried to piece them together like a jigsaw puzzle
 But it was challenging
 It's broken up into so many little tiny pieces, I'm trying to use sand and putty, and it's not looking good
 Ooh! NR: Yeah, right?
 It turns out it was way easier to do it virtually
 It's kind of magical when it all fits together
 How certain were you that you had it right, that you had put it together in the right way? Was there a potential that you'd put it together a different way and have, like, a parakeet or something?
  Um, no
 No, we got this
 What she had, she discovered, was a tibia, a leg bone, and specifically, one that belonged to a cloven-hoofed mammal, so something like a cow or a sheep
 But it couldn't have been either of those
 It was just too big
 The size of this thing, it was huge
 It's a really big animal
 So what animal could it be? Having hit a wall, she showed one of the fragments to some colleagues of hers in Colorado, and they had an idea
 It smelled kind of like singed flesh
 And usually, after so many years, it breaks down
 But in this case, the Arctic had acted like a natural freezer and preserved it
Then a year or two later, Natalia was at a conference in Bristol, and she saw that a colleague of hers named Mike Buckley was demoing this new process that he called "collagen fingerprinting
" It turns out that different species have slightly different structures of collagen, so if you get a collagen profile of an unknown bone, you can compare it to those of known species, and, who knows, maybe you get a match
So she shipped him one of the fragments, FedEx
 Yeah, you want to track it
 It's kind of important
 And he processed it, and compared it to 37 known and modern-day mammal species
 It turns out that the 3
5 million-year-old bone that Natalia had dug out of the High Arctic belonged to 
 a camel
 And I'm thinking, what? That's amazing -- if it's true
 So they tested a bunch of the fragments, and they got the same result for each one
 However, based on the size of the bone that they found, it meant that this camel was 30 percent larger than modern-day camels
 So this camel would have been about nine feet tall, weighed around a ton
Yeah
 Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel
 So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the High Arctic?
Well, scientists have known for a long time, turns out, even before Natalia's discovery, that camels are actually originally American
They started here
 For nearly 40 of the 45 million years that camels have been around, you could only find them in North America, around 20 different species, maybe more
 If I put them all in a lineup, would they look different?
 Yeah, you're going to have different body sizes
 You'll have some with really long necks, so they're actually functionally like giraffes
 Some had snouts, like crocodiles
 The really primitive, early ones would have been really small, almost like rabbits
 What? Rabbit-sized camels?
 The earliest ones
 So those ones you probably would not recognize
 And then around the end of the last ice age, North American camels went extinct
So, scientists knew all of that already, but it still doesn't fully explain how Natalia found one so far north
 Like, this is, temperature-wise, the polar opposite of the Sahara
 Now to be fair, three and a half million years ago, it was on average 22 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now
 So it would have been boreal forest, so more like the Yukon or Siberia today
 But still, like, they would have six-month-long winters where the ponds would freeze over
 You'd have 24 hours a day of straight darkness
 How? How is it that one of these Saharan superstars could ever have survived those arctic conditions?
Natalia and her colleagues think they have an answer
 And it's kind of brilliant
 What if the very features that we imagine make the camel so well-suited to places like the Sahara, actually evolved to help it get through the winter? What if those broad feet were meant to tromp not over sand, but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes? What if that hump -- which, huge news to me, does not contain water, it contains fat --
was there to help the camel get through that six-month-long winter, when food was scarce? And then, only later, long after it crossed over the land bridge did it retrofit those winter features for a hot desert environment? Like, for instance, the hump may be helpful to camels in hotter climes because having all your fat in one place, like a, you know, fat backpack, means that you don't have to have that insulation all over the rest of your body
 It's this crazy idea, that what seems like proof of the camel's quintessential desert nature could actually be proof of its High Arctic past
Now, I'm not the first person to tell this story
 Others have told it as a way to marvel at evolutionary biology or as a keyhole into the future of climate change
 But I love it for a totally different reason
 For me, it's a story about us, about how we see the world and about how that changes
 And I've learned that, actually, a lot of scientists are historians, too
 They make sense of the past
 They tell the history of our universe, of our planet, of life on this planet
 And as a historian, you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes
 We make up stories and we stick with it, like the camel in the desert, right? That's a great story! It's totally adapted for that
 Clearly, it always lived there
 But at any moment, you could uncover some tiny bit of evidence
 You could learn some tiny thing that forces you to reframe everything you thought you knew
 Like, in this case, this one scientist finds this one shard of what she thought was wood, and because of that, science has a totally new and totally counterintuitive theory about why this absurd Dr
 Seuss-looking creature looks the way it does
 And for me, it completely upended the way I think of the camel
 It went from being this ridiculously niche creature suited only to this one specific environment, to being this world traveler that just happens to be in the Sahara, and could end up virtually anywhere
This is Azuri
 Azuri, hi, how are you doing? OK, here, I've got one of these for you here
So Azuri is on a break from her regular gig at the Radio City Music Hall
That's not even a joke
 Anyway --
But really, Azuri is here as a living reminder that the story of our world is a dynamic one
 It requires our willingness to readjust, to reimagine
Right, Azuri?
Thank you very much
People returning to work after a career break: I call them relaunchers
 These are people who have taken career breaks for elder care, for childcare reasons, pursuing a personal interest or a personal health issue
 This disconnect is a problem that I'm trying to help solve
Now, successful relaunchers are everywhere and in every field
 This is Sami Kafala
 He's a nuclear physicist in the UK who took a five-year career break to be home with his five children
 The Singapore press recently wrote about nurses returning to work after long career breaks
 And speaking of long career breaks, this is Mimi Kahn
 She's a social worker in Orange County, California, who returned to work in a social services organization after a 25-year career break
 That's the longest career break that I'm aware of
 Tracy answered a call for essays by the Today Show from people who were trying to return to work but having a difficult time of it
 Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five who loved her time at home, but she had gone through a divorce and needed to return to work, plus she really wanted to bring work back into her life because she loved working
 Tracy was doing what so many of us do when we feel like we've put in a good day in the job search
 She was looking for a finance or accounting role, and she had just spent the last nine months very diligently researching companies online and applying for jobs with no results
I met Tracy in June of 2011, when the Today Show asked me if I could work with her to see if I could help her turn things around
 The first thing I told Tracy was she had to get out of the house
 I also told her, "You are going to have a lot of conversations that don't go anywhere
 There will be a handful that ultimately lead to a job opportunity
"
I'll tell you what happened with Tracy in a little bit, but I want to share with you a discovery that I made when I was returning to work after my own career break of 11 years out of the full-time workforce
 What I mean by this is, when you start to get in touch with people and you get back in touch with those people from the past, the people with whom you worked or went to school, they are going to remember you as you were before your career break
 And that's even if your sense of self has diminished over time, as happens with so many of us the farther removed we are from our professional identities
 So for example, you might think of yourself as someone who looks like this
 This is me, crazy after a day of driving around in my minivan
 Or here I am in the kitchen
 But those people from the past, they don't know about any of this
 They only remember you as you were, and it's a great confidence boost to be back in touch with these people and hear their enthusiasm about your interest in returning to work
There's one more thing I remember vividly from my own career break
 And that was that I hardly kept up with the business news
 My background is in finance, and I hardly kept up with any news when I was home caring for my four young children
 So I was afraid I'd go into an interview and start talking about a company that didn't exist anymore
 So I had to resubscribe to the Wall Street Journal and read it for a good six months cover to cover before I felt like I had a handle on what was going on in the business world again
I believe relaunchers are a gem of the workforce, and here's why
 Think about our life stage: for those of us who took career breaks for childcare reasons, we have fewer or no maternity leaves
 We have fewer spousal or partner job relocations
 We're in a more settled time of life
 We have great work experience
 We have a more mature perspective
 We're not trying to find ourselves at an employer's expense
 Plus we have an energy, an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely because we've been away from it for a while
On the flip side, I speak with employers, and here are two concerns that employers have about hiring relaunchers
 Now, I can tell you, having been technologically obsolete myself at one point, that it's a temporary condition
 I don't know if anyone can even remember back that far, but I had to relearn it on Excel
 It actually wasn't that hard
 A lot of the commands are the same
 I found PowerPoint much more challenging, but now I use PowerPoint all the time
 I tell relaunchers that employers expect them to come to the table with a working knowledge of basic office management software
 And if they're not up to speed, then it's their responsibility to get there
 And they do
The second area of concern that employers have about relaunchers is they're worried that relaunchers don't know what they want to do
 I tell relaunchers that they need to do the hard work to figure out whether their interests and skills have changed or have not changed while they have been on career break
 That's not the employer's job
 It's the relauncher's responsibility to demonstrate to the employer where they can add the most value
 I had been tracking return to work programs since 2008, and in 2010, I started noticing the use of a short-term paid work opportunity, whether it was called an internship or not, but an internship-like experience, as a way for professionals to return to work
 I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee start corporate reentry internship programs
 I saw a returning engineer, a nontraditional reentry candidate, apply for an entry-level internship program in the military, and then get a permanent job afterward
So I wrote a report about what I was seeing, and it became this article for Harvard Business Review called "The 40-Year-Old Intern
 And then, courtesy of Fox Business News, they called the concept "The 50-Year-Old Intern
"
So five of the biggest financial services companies have reentry internship programs for returning finance professionals
 And at this point, hundreds of people have participated
 And now, seven of the biggest engineering companies are piloting reentry internship programs for returning engineers as part of an initiative with the Society of Women Engineers
 This testing out period removes the perceived risk that some managers attach to hiring relaunchers, and they are attracting excellent candidates who are turning into great hires
 Before this, most employers were not interested in engaging with relaunchers at all
 But now, not only are programs being developed specifically with relaunchers in mind, but you can't even apply for these programs unless you have a gap on your résumé
This is the mark of real change, of true institutional shift, because if we can solve this problem for relaunchers, we can solve it for other career transitioners too
 In fact, an employer just told me that their veterans return to work program is based on their reentry internship program
 And there's no reason why there can't be a retiree internship program
 Different pool, same concept
So let me tell you what happened with Tracy Shapiro
 Remember that she had to tell everyone she knew about her interest in returning to work
 Well, one critical conversation with another parent in her community led to a job offer for Tracy, and it was an accounting job in a finance department
 But it was a temp job
 The company told her there was a possibility it could turn into something more, but no guarantees
 This was in the fall of 2011
 Tracy loved this company, and she loved the people and the office was less than 10 minutes from her house
 So even though she had a second job offer at another company for a permanent full-time role, she decided to take her chances with this internship and hope for the best
Fast forward to 2015, Tracy's been promoted
 They've paid for her to get her MBA at night
 She's even hired another relauncher to work for her
 Tracy's temp job was a tryout, just like an internship, and it ended up being a win for both Tracy and her employer
Now, my goal is to bring the reentry internship concept to more and more employers
 Be their first success story, and you can be the example for more relaunchers to come
Thank you
The following are my opinions, and do not reflect the opinions or policies of any particular prosecutor's office
I am a prosecutor
 I believe in law and order
 I am the adopted son of a police officer, a Marine and a hairdresser
 I believe in accountability and that we should all be safe in our communities
 I love my job and the people that do it
 I just think that it's our responsibility to do it better
By a show of hands, how many of you, by the age of 25, had either acted up in school, went somewhere you were specifically told to stay out of, or drank alcohol before your legal age?
All right
How many of you shoplifted, tried an illegal drug or got into a physical fight -- yes, even with a sibling? Now, how many of you ever spent one day in jail for any of those decisions? How many of you sitting here today think that you're a danger to society or should be defined by those actions of youthful indiscretion?
Point taken
When we talk about criminal justice reform, we often focus on a few things, and that's what I want to talk to you about today
 But first I'm going to -- since you shared with me, I'm going to give you a confession on my part
 I went to law school to make money
Near the end of my first year of law school, I got an internship in the Roxbury Division of Boston Municipal Court
 I knew of Roxbury as an impoverished neighborhood in Boston, plagued by gun violence and drug crime
 My life and my legal career changed the first day of that internship
 I walked into a courtroom, and I saw an auditorium of people who, one by one, would approach the front of that courtroom to say two words and two words only: "Not guilty
" They were predominately black and brown
 And then a judge, a defense attorney and a prosecutor would make life-altering decisions about that person without their input
 They were predominately white
 As each person, one by one, approached the front of that courtroom, I couldn't stop but think: How did they get here? I wanted to know their stories
 And as the prosecutor read the facts of each case, I was thinking to myself, we could have predicted that
 That seems so preventable
 not because I was an expert in criminal law, but because it was common sense
Over the course of the internship, I began to recognize people in the auditorium, not because they were criminal masterminds but because they were coming to us for help and we were sending them out without any
My second year of law school I worked as a paralegal for a defense attorney, and in that experience I met many young men accused of murder
 Even in our "worst," I saw human stories
 And they all contained childhood trauma, victimization, poverty, loss, disengagement from school, early interaction with the police and the criminal justice system, all leading to a seat in a courtroom
 Those convicted of murder were condemned to die in prison, and it was during those meetings with those men that I couldn't fathom why we would spend so much money to keep this one person in jail for the next 80 years when we could have reinvested it up front, and perhaps prevented the whole thing from happening in the first place
 They would come to us, and we would send them away without that help
 But we weren't giving them any
 Prosecuted, adjudged and defended by people who knew nothing about them
The staggering inefficiency is what drove me to criminal justice work
 The unfairness of it all made me want to be a defender
 The power dynamic that I came to understand made me become a prosecutor
I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about the problem
 We know the criminal justice system needs reform, we know there are 2
3 million people in American jails and prisons, making us the most incarcerated nation on the planet
 We know there's another seven million people on probation or parole, we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately affects people of color, particularly poor people of color
 And we know there are system failures happening everywhere that bring people to our courtrooms
 But what we do not discuss is how ill-equipped our prosecutors are to receive them
 When we talk about criminal justice reform, we, as a society, focus on three things
 We complain, we tweet, we protest about the police, about sentencing laws and about prison
 We rarely, if ever, talk about the prosecutor
In the fall of 2009, a young man was arrested by the Boston Police Department
 He was 18 years old, he was African American and he was a senior at a local public school
 He had his sights set on college but his part-time, minimum-wage job wasn't providing the financial opportunity he needed to enroll in school
 In a series of bad decisions, he stole 30 laptops from a store and sold them on the Internet
 This led to his arrest and a criminal complaint of 30 felony charges
 The potential jail time he faced is what stressed Christopher out the most
 But what he had little understanding of was the impact a criminal record would have on his future
I was standing in arraignments that day when Christopher's case came across my desk
 And at the risk of sounding dramatic, in that moment, I had Christopher's life in my hands
 I was 29 years old, a brand-new prosecutor, and I had little appreciation for how the decisions I would make would impact Christopher's life
 Christopher's case was a serious one and it needed to be dealt with as such, but I didn't think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer
For the most part, prosecutors step onto the job with little appreciation of the impact of our decisions, regardless of our intent
 Despite our broad discretion, we learn to avoid risk at all cost, rendering our discretion basically useless
 We're judged internally and externally by our convictions and our trial wins, so prosecutors aren't really incentivized to be creative at our case positions, dispositions, or to take risks on people we might not otherwise
 We stick to an outdated method, counterproductive to achieving the very goal that we all want, and that's safer communities
Yet most prosecutors standing in my space would have arraigned Christopher
 They have little appreciation for what we can do
 Arraigning Christopher would give him a criminal record, making it harder for him to get a job, setting in motion a cycle that defines the failing criminal justice system today
 Without those protective factors in his life, Christopher would be more likely to commit further, more serious crime
 And, ladies and gentlemen, it is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us
 I came out as a prosecutor expected to do justice, but I never learned what justice was in my classes -- none of us do
 None of us do
And yet, prosecutors are the most powerful actors in the criminal justice system
 In most cases, not the judge, not the police, not the legislature, not the mayor, not the governor, not the President can tell us how to prosecute our cases
 The decision to arraign Christopher and give him a criminal record was exclusively mine
 I would choose whether to prosecute him for 30 felonies, for one felony, for a misdemeanor, or at all
 I would choose whether to leverage Christopher into a plea deal or take the case to trial, and ultimately, I would be in a position to ask for Christopher to go to jail
 These are decisions that prosecutors make every day unfettered, and we are unaware and untrained of the grave consequences of those decisions
One night this past summer, I was at a small gathering of professional men of color from around the city
 As I stood there stuffing free finger sandwiches into my mouth, as you do as public servant --
I noticed across the room, a young man waving and smiling at me and approaching me
 And thanking me
 "You cared about me, and you changed my life
" It was Christopher
See, I never arraigned Christopher
 Instead, I worked with Christopher; first on being accountable for his actions, and then, putting him in a position where he wouldn't re-offend
 We recovered 75 percent of the computers that he sold and gave them back to Best Buy, and came up with a financial plan to repay for the computers we couldn't recover
 Christopher did community service
 He wrote an essay reflecting on how this case could impact his future and that of the community
 He applied to college, he obtained financial aid, and he went on to graduate from a four-year school
After we finished hugging, I looked at his name tag, to learn that Christopher was the manager of a large bank in Boston
He had accomplished all of this in the six years since I had first seen him in Roxbury Court
 I can't take credit for Christopher's journey to success, but I certainly did my part to keep him on the path
There are thousands of Christophers out there, some locked in our jails and prisons
 We need thousands of prosecutors to recognize that and to protect them
 It's a bigger win for all of us
 In retrospect, the decision not to throw the book at Christopher makes perfect sense
 When I saw him that first day in Roxbury Court, I didn't see a criminal standing there
 As an individual caught selling a large quantity of drugs in my late teens, I knew firsthand the power of opportunity as opposed to the wrath of the criminal justice system
 Along the way, with the help and guidance of my district attorney, my supervisor and judges, I learned the power of the prosecutor to change lives instead of ruining them
 We helped a woman who was arrested for stealing groceries to feed her kids get a job
 Instead of putting an abused teenager in adult jail for punching another teenager, we secured mental health treatment and community supervision
 A runaway girl who was arrested for prostituting, to survive on the streets, needed a safe place to live and grow -- something we could help her with
 We would spend our time that we'd normally take prepping our cases for months and months for trial down the road by coming up with real solutions to the problems as they presented
Which is the better way to spend our time? How would you prefer your prosecutors to spend theirs? Why are we spending 80 billion dollars on a prison industry that we know is failing, when we could take that money and reallocate it into education, into mental health treatment, into substance abuse treatment and to community investment so we can develop our neighborhoods?
 It costs 109,000 dollars in some states to lock up a teenager for a year, with a 60 percent chance that that person will return to the very same system
 That is a terrible return on investment
 it's the right thing to do
 If prosecutors were a part of creating the problem, it's incumbent on us to create a solution and we can do that using other disciplines that have already done the data and research for us
 your voice and your vote can make that happen
 The next time there's a local district attorney's election in your jurisdiction, ask candidates these questions
 One: What are you doing to make me and my neighbors safer? Two: What data are you collecting, and how are you training your prosecutors to make sure that it's working? And number three: If it's not working for everybody, what are you doing to fix it? If they can't answer the questions, they shouldn't be doing the job
Each one of you that raised your hand at the beginning of this talk is a living, breathing example of the power of opportunity, of intervention, of support and of love
 While each of you may have faced your own brand of discipline for whatever malfeasances you committed, barely any of you needed a day in jail to make you the people that you are today -- some of the greatest minds on the planet
Every day, thousands of times a day, prosecutors around the United States wield power so great that it can bring about catastrophe as quickly as it can bring about opportunity, intervention, support and yes, even love
 Those qualities are the hallmarks of a strong community, and a strong community is a safe one
 If our communities are broken, don't let the lawyers that you elect fix them with outdated, inefficient, expensive methods
Demand more; vote for the prosecutor who's helping people stay out of jail, not putting them in
Demand better
 You deserve it, your children deserve it, the people who are tied up in the system deserve it, but most of all, the people that we are sworn to protect and do justice for demand it
We must, we must do better
Thank you
Thank you very much
Today's computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how terrible they really are
 I'd like to talk to you today about this problem, and how we can fix it with neuroscience
First, I'd like to take you back to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011 that had a profound impact on me
 I was sitting in a dive bar outside of Columbia University, where I studied computer science and neuroscience, and I was having this great conversation with a fellow student about the power of holograms to one day replace computers
 And just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation, of course, his phone lights up
 And he pulls it towards himself, and he looks down and he starts typing
 And then he forces his eyeballs back up to mine and he goes, "Keep going
 I'm with you
" But of course his eyes were glazed over, and the moment was dead
Meanwhile across the bar, I noticed another student holding his phone, this time towards a group
 And that dichotomy between how crappy I was feeling and how happy they were feeling about the same technology, really got me thinking
See, they were connected around something, just like our ancestors who evolved their social cognitions telling stories around the campfire
 And that's exactly what tools should do, I think
 They should extend our bodies
 Whether you're sending an email to your wife or you're composing a symphony or just consoling a friend, you're doing it in pretty much the same way
 You're hunched over these rectangles, fumbling with buttons and menus and more rectangles
 And I think this is the wrong way, I think we can start using a much more natural machine
 We should use machines that bring our work back into the world
Now it just so happens that I have such a machine here
 It's called the Meta 2
 Let's try it out
 Now in front of me right now, I can see the audience, and I can see my very hands
 And in three, two, one, we're going to see an immersive hologram appear, a very realistic hologram appear in front of me, of our very glasses I'm wearing on my head right now
 And I think Iron Man would be proud
 We're going to come back to this in just a bit
Now if you're anything like me, your mind is already reeling with the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology, so let's look at a few
My mom is an architect, so naturally the first thing I imagined was laying out a building in 3D space instead of having to use these 2D floor plans
 She's actually touching graphics right now and selecting an interior decor
 This was all shot through a GoPro through our very glasses
And this next use case is very personal to me, it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's glass brain project, courtesy of UCSF
 As a neuroscience student, I would always fantasize about the ability to learn and memorize these complex brain structures with an actual machine, where I could touch and play with the various brain structures
Now what you're seeing is called augmented reality, but to me, it's part of a much more important story -- a story of how we can begin to extend our bodies with digital devices, instead of the other way around
Now 
 We're going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world
 Just imagine for a moment what this could mean for storytellers, for painters, for brain surgeons, for interior decorators and maybe for all of us here today
 And what I think we need to do as a community, is really try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that extends the human experience, instead of gamifying our reality or cluttering it with digital information
 And that's what I'm very passionate about
Now, I want to tell you a little secret
 In about five years -- this is not the smallest device -- in about five years, these are all going to look like strips of glass on our eyes that project holograms
 And it's very, very important that we get this right, because we might be living inside of these things for at least as long as we've lived with the Windows graphical user interface
To isolate the single most intuitive interface out of infinity, we use neuroscience to drive our design guidelines, instead of letting a bunch of designers fight it out in the boardroom
 And the principle we all revolve around is what's called the "Neural Path of Least Resistance
"
At every turn, we're connecting the iOS of the brain with our brain on, for the first time, our brain's terms
 We're building a system that you've always known how to use
 First and foremost, you are the operating system
 Traditional file systems are complex and abstract, and they take your brain extra steps to decode them
 We're going against the Neural Path of Least Resistance
 Meanwhile, in augmented reality, you can of course place your holographic TED panel over here, and your holographic email on the other side of the desk, and your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and retrieve them
 You could put your holographic Tesla that you're shopping for -- or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show
Perfect
 And your brain knows exactly how to get it back
" What do babies do when they see something that grabs their interest? They try and reach out and touch it
 And that's exactly how the natural machine should work as well
 So by touching our work directly, we're not only going to control it better, we're also going to understand it much more deeply
 Hence, touch to see
But it's not enough to experience things ourselves
 We're inherently these social primates
 And this leads me to our third guideline, the holographic campfire from our first story
Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that we can connect with each other and with our work much better if we can see each other's faces and hands in 3D
 So if you look at the video behind me, you can see two Meta users playing around with the same hologram, making eye contact, connected around this thing, instead of being distracted by external devices
Let's go ahead and try this again with neuroscience in mind
 I'm going to now take a step further and go ahead and grab this pair of glasses and leave it right here by the desk
 I'm now with you, I'm in the moment, we're connecting
 My spatial memory kicks in, and I can go ahead and grab it and bring it right back here, reminding me that I am the operating system
 And now my proprioception is working, and I can go ahead and explode these glasses into a thousand parts and touch the very sensor that is currently scanning my hand
But it's not enough to see things alone, so in a second, my co-founder Ray is going to make a 3D call -- Ray?
Hey Ray, how's it going? Guys, I can see this guy in front me in full 3D
 And he is photo-realistic
Thank you
My mirror-neuron subsystem suggests that this is going to replace phones in not too long
 Ray, how's it going?
 Great
 We're live today
 Ray, give the crowd a gift of the holographic brain we saw from the video earlier
 Guys, this is not only going to change phones, it's also going to change the way we collaborate
Thank you so much
Thanks, Ray
 You're welcome
 So folks, this is the message that I discovered in that bar in 2011: The future of computers is not locked inside one of these screens
 Which is why all hundred of us at Meta, including the administrative staff, the executives, the designers, the engineers -- before TED2017, we're all going to be throwing away our external monitors and replacing them with a truly and profoundly more natural machine
Thank you very much
Thank you, appreciate it
 Thanks, guys
 So help me out on one thing, because there've been a few augmented reality demos shown over the last year or so out there
 And there's sometimes a debate among technologists about, are we really seeing the real thing on-screen? There's this issue of field of view, that somehow the technology is showing a broader view than you would actually see wearing the glasses
 Were we seeing the real deal there?
 Absolutely the real deal
 Not only that, we took extra measures to shoot it with a GoPro through the actual lens in the various videos that you've seen here
 We want to try to simulate the experience for the world that we're actually seeing through the glasses, and not cut any corners
 Thank you so much for showing us that
 Thanks so much, I appreciate that
I come from one of the most liberal, tolerant, progressive places in the United States, Seattle, Washington
 And I grew up with a family of great Seattlites
 My mother was an artist, my father was a college professor, and I am truly grateful for my upbringing, because I always felt completely comfortable designing my life exactly as I saw fit
 When I was 19, I dropped out of college -- dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs
And I went on the road as a professional French horn player, which was my lifelong dream
 I played chamber music all over the United States and Europe, and I toured for a couple of years with a great jazz guitar player named Charlie Bird
 And by the end of my 20s, I wound up as a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain
 What a great life
And you know, my parents never complained
 They supported me all the way through it
 It wasn't their dream
 They used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son, he's taking a gap decade
"
 I was 27, and I was home from Barcelona, and I was visiting my parents for Christmas, and I was cooking dinner with my mother, and we were alone in the kitchen
 And she was quiet, too quiet
 Something was wrong
 And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?" And she said, "Your dad and I are really worried about you
" And I said, "What?" I mean, what could it be, at this point? And she said, "I want you to be completely honest with me: have you been voting for Republicans?"
Now, the truth is, I wasn't really political, I was just a French horn player
 But I had a bit of an epiphany, and they had detected it, and it was causing some confusion
 You see, I had become an enthusiast for capitalism, and I want to tell you why that is
 It stems from a lifelong interest of mine in, believe it or not, poverty
See, when I was a kid growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw real poverty
 That's not even close
 The first time I saw poverty, and poverty's face, was when I was six or seven years old, early 1970s
 And it was like a lot of you, kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite
 And he wasn't going to make it, and I knew that, and I was helpless
 Some of you remember that picture, not exactly that picture, one just like it
 It introduced the West to grinding poverty around the world
 And I wondered, what happened to that kid? Or to people just like him all over the world? And so I started to study, even though I wasn't in college, I was looking for the answer: what happened to the world's poorest people? Has it gotten worse? Has it gotten better? What?
And I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I want to share it with you
 But here's the truth
 Here's the epiphany that I had that changed my thinking
 There's been an 80 percent decline in the world's worst poverty since I was a kid
 And I didn't even know about it
 This, my friends, that's a miracle
So when I learned this, I asked, what did that? What made it possible? Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again
 If you want to replicate it and get the next two billion people out of poverty, because that's what we're talking about: since I was a kid, two billion of the least of these, our brothers and sisters, have been pulled out of poverty
 I want the next two billion, so I've got to know why
 And it wasn't a political answer, because I didn't care
And here it is
 Here are the reasons
 There are five reasons that two billion of our brothers and sisters have been pulled out of poverty since I was a kid
 Number one: globalization
 Number two: free trade
 Number three: property rights
 Number four: rule of law
 Number five: entrepreneurship
 It was the free enterprise system spreading around the world after 1970 that did that
Now, I'm not naive
 I know that free enterprise isn't perfect, and I know that free enterprise isn't everything we need to build a better world
 But that is great
 And that's beyond politics
 This is the epiphany
 At its best, it's about aspiration, which is what so many people on this stage talk about, is the aspiration that comes from dreams that are embedded in the free enterprise system
 And we've got to share it with more people
 The best quote I've ever heard to summarize the thoughts that I've just given you about pulling people out of poverty is as follows: "Free markets have created more wealth than any system in history
 They have lifted billions out of poverty
"
 Wrong
 President Barack Obama said that
 Crazy
 And I said, "Hallelujah
" But more than that, I said, "What an opportunity
"
You know what I was a thinking? It was at an event that we were doing on the subject at Georgetown University in May of 2015
Now, I don't have to tell anybody in this room that we're in a crisis, in America and many countries around the world with political polarization
 It's risen to critical, crisis levels
 It's unpleasant
 It's not right
 There was an article last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals published in the West
 And it was an article in 2014 on political motive asymmetry
 What's that? That's what psychologists call the phenomenon of assuming that your ideology is based in love but your opponents' ideology is based in hate
 It's common in world conflict
 You expect to see this between Palestinians and Israelis, for example
 What the authors of this article found was that in America today, a majority of Republicans and Democrats suffer from political motive asymmetry
 A majority of people in our country today who are politically active believe that they are motivated by love but the other side is motivated by hate
 Think about it
 Most people are walking around saying, "You know, my ideology is based on basic benevolence, I want to help people, but the other guys, they're evil and out to get me
 Let's not minimize the differences
 That would be really naïve
 There's a lot of good research on this
 A veteran of the TED stage is my friend Jonathan Haidt
 He's a psychology professor at New York University
 He does work on the ideology and values and morals of different people to see how they differ
 And he's shown, for example, that conservatives and liberals have a very different emphasis on what they think is important
 For example, Jon Haidt has shown that liberals care about poverty 59 percent more than they care about economic liberty
 And conservatives care about economic liberty 28 percent more than they care about poverty
Irreconcilable differences, right? We'll never come together
 Wrong
 It was the obsession with poverty, accompanied by the method of economic freedom spreading around the world
 We need each other, in other words, if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty
Hmm
 How are we going to get that? It's a tricky thing, isn't it
 We need innovative thinking
 Social entrepreneurship
 Yeah
 Absolutely
 We need investment overseas in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way
 Yes
But you know what we really need? We need a new day in flexible ideology
 We need to be less predictable
 Right? Now those are important things, really important to me, really important to you
 That's the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country, if we choose to take it
So how are we going to do it? How are we going to do it together? I've got to have some action items, not just for you but for me
 Action item number one: remember, it's not good enough just to tolerate people who disagree
 It's not good enough
 Now, what are you going to do? How are you going to express that? Where does this start? It starts here
 You know, all of us in this room, we're blessed
 We're blessed with prosperity
 When people hear us, with the kind of unpredictable ideology, then maybe people will listen
 Maybe progress will start at that point
 That's number one
 Number two
 Number two: I'm asking you and I'm asking me to be the person specifically who blurs the lines, who is ambiguous, who is hard to classify
 If you're a conservative, be the conservative who is always going on about poverty and the moral obligation to be a warrior for the poor
 And if you're a liberal, be a liberal who is always talking about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems when we use them responsibly
If we do that, we get two things
 Number one: we get to start to work on the next two billion and be the solution that we've seen so much of in the past and we need to see more of in the future
 That's what we get
 And the second is that we might just be able to take the ghastly holy war of ideology that we're suffering under in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on solidarity and mutual respect
 And then maybe, just maybe, we'll all realize that our big differences aren't really that big after all
Thank you
Hannah is excited to be going to college
 She couldn't wait to get out of her parents' house, to prove to them that she's an adult, and to prove to her new friends that she belongs
She heads to a campus party where she sees a guy that she has a crush on
 Let's call him Mike
 The next day, Hannah wakes up with a pounding headache
 She can only remember the night in flashes
 But what she does remember is throwing up in the hall outside Mike's room and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her, wanting it to stop, then shakily stumbling home
 She doesn't feel good about what happened, but she thinks, "Maybe this is just what sex in college is?"
 Less than 10 percent will ever report their assault to their school or to the police
 But when she sees Mike taking girls home from parties, she's worried about them
After graduation, Hannah learns that she was one of five women who Mike did the exact same thing to
 And this is not an unlikely scenario because 90 percent of sexual assaults are committed by repeat offenders
 But with such low reporting rates, it's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported, much less anything happen if they are
In fact, only six percent of assaults reported to the police end with the assailant spending a single day in prison
 Meaning, there's a 99 percent chance that they'll get away with it
Now, I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training
 I'm interested in systems and networks and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good
 So this, to me, is a tragic but a solvable problem
So when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago, it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change
 And so we did
 We started by talking to college survivors
 And what they wish they'd had in college is pretty simple; they wanted a website, one they could use at the time and place that felt safest to them with clearly written information about their reporting options, with the ability to electronically report their assault, rather than having the first step to go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them
 With the option to create a secure, timestamped document of what happened to them, preserving evidence even if they don't want to report yet
 And lastly, and perhaps most critically, with the ability to report their assault only if someone else reported the same assailant
 You see, knowing that you weren't the only one changes everything
 It changes the way you frame your own experience, it changes the way you think about your perpetrator, it means that if you do come forward, you'll have someone else's back and they'll have yours
We created a website that actually does this and we launched it [
] in August, on two college campuses
If a system like this had existed for Hannah and her peers, it's more likely that they would have reported, that they would have been believed, and that Mike would have been kicked off campus, gone to jail, or at least gotten the help that he needed
 And if we were able to stop repeat offenders like Mike after just their second assault following a match, survivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted in the first place
 We could prevent 59 percent of sexual assaults just by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on
 And because we're creating a real deterrent to assault, for perhaps the first time, maybe the Mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone
The type of system I'm describing, the type of system that survivors want is a type of information escrow, meaning an entity that holds on to information for you and only releases it to a third party when certain pre-agreed upon conditions are met, such as a match
 The application that we built is for college campuses
 But the same type of system could be used in the military or even the workplace
We don't have to live in a world where 99 percent of rapists get away with it
 We can create one where those who do wrong are held accountable, where survivors get the support and justice they deserve, where the authorities get the information they need, and where there's a real deterrent to violating the rights of another human being
So in college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers
 Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this
 So, you know --
 That would be the plan
 I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this
And that would happen every single paper
But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on
 So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this
 This is how the year would go
 So I'd start off light, and I'd bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase
 How hard could it be to walk up the stairs? No big deal, right?
But then, the funniest thing happened
 Those first few months? They came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff
 So we had an awesome new revised plan
And then --
 And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks
 And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters -- humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters -- sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline
I thought that was the end of everything
 But a week later I get a call, and it's the school
 And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?" And I say, "Yeah
" And they say, "We need to talk about your thesis
" And I say, "OK
" And they say, "It's the best one we've ever seen
It was a very, very bad thesis
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought, "This guy is amazing!"
No, no, it was very, very bad
 Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy
 I write the blog Wait But Why
 And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination
 My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators, and why we are the way we are
 Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people
 And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them
 I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference
 I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator
Now 
 here's my brain
There is a difference
 Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey
 Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens
[This is a perfect time to get some work done
] [Nope!]
So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel, and he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened
 Sorry!"
Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel
 He lives entirely in the present moment
 He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun
Now, in the animal world, that works fine
 If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success!
And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species
 You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked OK
 But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times
 We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is
 Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do
 We can visualize the future
 We can see the big picture
 We can make long-term plans
 And he wants to take all of that into account
 And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now
 Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time
 That's why there's an overlap
 Sometimes they agree
 But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture
 And that's when we have a conflict
Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well
 The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred -- all of those good procrastinator feelings
Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments -- someone called the Panic Monster
Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence
 And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of
 Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk
Now, of course, I said yes
 But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind
 He was saying, "Are we clear on what we just accepted? Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future? We need to sit down and work on this right now
" And the Monkey said, "Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India
"
So that's what we did that day
As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speakers
So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem
And the Monkey -- remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster -- boom, he's up the tree! And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk
 And this entire situation, with the three characters -- this is the procrastinator's system
 It's not pretty, but in the end, it works
 This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago
When I did, I was amazed by the response
 Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things
And they were all writing, saying the same thing: "I have this problem too
" But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails
 And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on? Why are all of these people in such a dark place?
Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination
 Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines
 But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline
 So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter -- something in the arts, something entrepreneurial -- there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum, get things going
 There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn't working
Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't show up
 He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained; they just extend outward forever
 And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind
 It's usually suffered quietly and privately
 And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets
 And I thought, that's why those people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place
 It's not that they're cramming for some project
 It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives
 The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams; it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them
So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany -- that I don't think non-procrastinators exist
 That's right -- I think all of you are procrastinators
 Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us,
and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there
Now, I want to show you one last thing
 I call this a Life Calendar
 That's one box for every week of a 90-year life
 That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those
 So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar
 We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey
Well, maybe not today, but 
You know
 Sometime soon
Thank you
 And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda and he starts looking through my stuff
 And it turns out he's alone in town for the night, driving cross-country on a road trip before he goes into the Peace Corps
 So I invite him out for a beer and he tells me all about his passion for making a difference in the world
" And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!" What do you do? We've all been there, right? Do I offer to host this guy? But, I just met him -- I mean, he says he's going to the Peace Corps, but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata
 That's a small trunk!
So then I hear myself saying, "Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room
" And the voice in my head goes, "Wait, what?"
That night, I'm laying in bed, I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking, "Oh my god, what have I done? There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room
 What if he's psychotic?" My anxiety grows so much, I leap out of bed, I sneak on my tiptoes to the door, and I lock the bedroom door
It turns out he was not psychotic
 We've kept in touch ever since
 And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now
 Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers were actually friends waiting to be discovered
So now it's two years later
 I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke, my roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up
 And I've always believed that turning fear into fun is the gift of creativity
So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks -- turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,' offering young designers who come to town a place to crash, complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space, sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning
We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born
 Three lucky guests got to stay on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor
 But they loved it, and so did we
 I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made tasted totally different because we made them for our guests
 We took them on adventures around the city, and when we said goodbye to the last guest, the door latch clicked, Brian and I just stared at each other
 Did we just discover it was possible to make friends while also making rent?
The wheels had started to turn
 My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined as engineering co-founder
 And we buckled down to see if we could turn this into a business
 And then, over the Internet, they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes
We sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off
 It did not
 No one in their right minds would invest in a service that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes
 Why? Because we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger
Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know, and all we really knew was design
 In art school, you learn that design is much more than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience
 We learned to do that for objects, but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust between people who had never met
 Could design make that happen? Is it possible to design for trust?
I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust that we were aiming to achieve
 If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up
 OK, I need you to take out your phones
 Because the only thing more personal than your phone is your home
 People don't just see your messages, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet
Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone? Most of us feel really responsible
 That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home
 And it's because of this that our company can even exist
 By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?
OK, you can hand your phones back now
So now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge we were facing, I'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way
 What if we changed one small thing about the design of that experiment? What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name, where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog? Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying, "They're great at holding unlocked phones!"
Now how would you feel about handing your phone over?
It turns out, a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust
 And we didn't actually get it right the first time
 Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts left the review before we reveal them
Now, here's a discovery we made just last week
 We did a joint study with Stanford, where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone based on how similar they are in age, location and geography
 The research showed, not surprisingly, we prefer people who are like us
 The more different somebody is, the less we trust them
 Now, that's a natural social bias
 But what's interesting is what happens when you add reputation into the mix, in this case, with reviews
Now, if you've got less than three reviews, nothing changes
 But if you've got more than 10, everything changes
 High reputation beats high similarity
 This is what happens when a guest first messages a host
 And if you share too much, like, "I'm having issues with my mother,"
acceptance rates also go down
 But there's a zone that's just right, like, "Love the artwork in your place
 Coming for vacation with my family
" So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure? We use the size of the box to suggest the right length, and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing
We bet our whole company on the hope that, with the right design, people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias
 What we didn't realize is just how many people were ready and waiting to put the bias aside
This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption
 There's three things happening here
 The first, an unbelievable amount of luck
 The second is the efforts of our team
 And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need
 Now, things have been going pretty well
Obviously, there are times when things don't work out
 Guests have thrown unauthorized parties and trashed homes
 In the early days, I was customer service, and those calls came right to my cell phone
 I was at the front lines of trust breaking
 And there's nothing worse than those calls, it hurts to even think about them
 And the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice was and, I would say, still is our single greatest motivator to keep improving
Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted, less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic
 And when trust works out right, it can be absolutely magical
We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay, and he suffered a heart attack
 The host rushed him to the hospital
 They donated their own blood for his operation
 Let me read you his review
"Excellent house for sedentary travelers prone to myocardial infarctions
The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals
Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels who will save your life without even knowing you
 They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass
 They don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read
Of course, not every stay is like that
Now, when I heard that term, I have to admit, it tripped me up
 How do sharing and transactions go together? So let's be clear; it is about commerce
 But if you just called it the rental economy, it would be incomplete
 The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection
 People share a part of themselves, and that changes everything
You know how most travel today is, like, I think of it like fast food -- it's efficient and consistent, at the cost of local and authentic
 What if travel were like a magnificent buffet of local experiences? What if anywhere you visited, there was a central marketplace of locals offering to get you thoroughly drunk on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn't even know existed
 Or learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant?
Today, homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation
 What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up? What would that look like? What if cities embraced a culture of sharing? I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection instead of isolation and separation
In South Korea, in the city of Seoul, they've actually even started this
 They're connecting students who need a place to live with empty-nesters who have extra rooms
 And they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation of sharing economy start-ups
Tonight, just on our service, 785,000 people in 191 countries will either stay in a stranger's home or welcome one into theirs
 Clearly, it's not as crazy as we were taught
We didn't invent anything new
 There's been many other websites like ours
 So, why did ours eventually take off? Luck and timing aside, I've learned that you can take the components of trust, and you can design for that
 Design can overcome our most deeply rooted stranger-danger bias
 And that's amazing to me
 It blows my mind
 I think about this every time I see a red Miata go by
Now, we know design won't solve all the world's problems
 But if it can help out with this one, if it can make a dent in this, it makes me wonder, what else can we design for next?
Thank you
There we were, souls and bodies packed into a Texas church on the last night of our lives
 A room like this, nonetheless
 With the same great feelings of suspense, the same deep hopes for salvation, the same sweat in the palms and the same people in the back not paying attention
 I had turned 12 that year and had reached the age of accountability
 And once I stopped complaining about how unfair it was that Jesus would return as soon as I had to be accountable for all that I had done, I figured I had better get my house in order very quickly
 I listened for silence as anxiously as one might listen for noise, trying to be sure that the Lord hadn't pulled a fast one on me and decided to come back early
And just in case he did, I built a backup plan, by reading the "Left Behind" books that were all the rage at the time
 And I found in their pages that if I was not taken in the rapture at midnight, I had another shot
 It would be hard --
 It was 11:50pm
 So every faction of the congregation took its place
 The choir stayed in the choir stand, the deacons and their wives -- or the Baptist Bourgeoisie as I like to call them --
took first position in front of the altar
 You see, in America, even the Second Coming of Christ has a VIP section
And right behind the Baptist Bourgeoisie were the elderly -- these men and women whose young backs had been bent under hot suns in the cotton fields of East Texas, and whose skin seemed to be burnt a creaseless noble brown, just like the clay of East Texas, and whose hopes and dreams for what life might become outside of East Texas had sometimes been bent and broken even further than their backs
 They had waited their whole lives for this moment, just as their medieval predecessors had longed for the end of the world, and just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey Show to come on Channel 8 every day at 4 o'clock
 And as she made her way to the altar, I snuck right in behind her, because I knew for sure that my grandmother was going to heaven
So I held on and I closed my eyes to listen, to wait
 And the prayers got louder
 And my hand gripped firmer, so I wouldn't be the one left in the field
 My eyes clenched tighter so I wouldn't see the wheat being separated from the chaff
 And then a voice rang out above us: "Amen
"
It was over
 I looked at the clock
 It was after midnight
 I looked at the elder believers whose savior had not come, who were too proud to show any signs of disappointment, who had believed too much and for too long to start doubting now
 But I was upset on their behalf
 They had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled, and I had gone right along with them
 I had prayed their prayers, I had yielded not to temptation as best I could
 I had believed
I got home just in time to turn on the television and watch Peter Jennings announce the new millennium as it rolled in around the world
 It struck me that it would have been strange anyway, for Jesus to come back again and again based on the different time zones
And this made me feel even more ridiculous -- hurt, really
 But there on that night, I did not stop believing
 I just believed a new thing: that it was possible not to believe
 And now, where there was once a mountain of certitude, there was, running right down to its foundation, a spring of doubt, a spring that promised rivers
I can trace the whole drama of my life back to that night in that church when my savior did not come for me; when the thing I believed most certainly turned out to be, if not a lie, then not quite the truth
 And even though most of you prepared for Y2K in a very different way, I'm convinced that you are here because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the dawn of this new century, since my mother left and my father stayed away and my Lord refused to come
 And I held out my hand, reaching for something to believe in
I held on when I arrived at Yale at 18, with the faith that my journey from Oak Cliff, Texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known, the broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen
 But when I found myself back home one winter break, with my face planted in the floor, my hands tied behind my back and a burglar's gun pressed to my head, I knew that even the best education couldn't save me
I held on when I showed up at Lehman Brothers as an intern in 2008
So hopeful --
that I called home to inform my family that we'd never be poor again
But as I witnessed this temple of finance come crashing down before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn't save me
I held on when I showed up in Washington DC as a young staffer, who had heard a voice call out from Illinois, saying, "It's been a long time coming, but in this election, change has come to America
I had knelt faithfully at the altar of the American Dream, praying to the gods of my time of success, and money, and power
 But over and over again, midnight struck, and I opened my eyes to see that all of these gods were dead
And from that graveyard, I began the search once more, not because I was brave, but because I knew that I would either believe or I would die
So I took a pilgrimage to yet another mecca, Harvard Business School --
 No, I knew there'd be more work to do
The work began in the dark corner of a crowded party, in the late night of an early, miserable Cambridge winter, when three friends and I asked a question that young folks searching for something real have asked for a very long time: "What if we took a road trip?"
We didn't know where'd we go or how we'd get there, but we knew we had to do it
 Because all our lives we yearned, as Jack Kerouac wrote, to "sneak out into the night and disappear somewhere," and go find out what everybody was doing all over the country
 So even though there were other voices who said that the risk was too great and the proof too thin, we went on anyhow
 And having been trained at the West Point of capitalism, this struck us as a revolutionary idea
And this idea spread, growing into a nonprofit called MBAs Across America, a movement that landed me here on this stage today
 It spread because we found countless entrepreneurs in the nooks and crannies of America who were creating jobs and changing lives and who needed a little help
But if I'm being honest, it also spread because I fought to spread it
 There was no length to which I would not go to preach this gospel, to get more people to believe that we could bind the wounds of a broken country, one social business at a time
 But it was this journey of evangelism that led me to the rather different gospel that I've come to share with you today
It began one evening almost a year ago at the Museum of Natural History in New York City, at a gala for alumni of Harvard Business School
 Under a full-size replica of a whale, I sat with the titans of our time as they celebrated their peers and their good deeds
 We looked over all that we had made, and it was good
But it just so happened, two days later, I had to travel up the road to Harlem, where I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vacant lot, listening to a man named Tony tell me of the kids that showed up there every day
 All of them lived below the poverty line
 Many of them carried all of their belongings in a backpack to avoid losing them in a homeless shelter
 Some of them came to Tony's program, called Harlem Grown, to get the only meal they had each day
 Tony told me that he started Harlem Grown with money from his pension, after 20 years as a cab driver
 He told me that he didn't give himself a salary, because despite success, the program struggled for resources
 He told me that he would take any help that he could get
 And I was there as that help
 I felt the weight of revelation that I could sit in one room on one night, where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars, and another room, two days later, just 50 blocks up the road, where a man was going without a salary to get a child her only meal of the day
And it wasn't the glaring inequality that made me want to cry, it wasn't the thought of hungry, homeless kids, it wasn't rage toward the one percent or pity toward the 99
 No, I was disturbed because I had finally realized that I was the dialysis for a country that needed a kidney transplant
 I realized that my story stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bootstraps, even if they didn't have any boots; that my organization stood in for all the structural, systemic help that never went to Harlem or Appalachia or the Lower 9th Ward; that my voice stood in for all those voices that seemed too unlearned, too unwashed, too unaccommodated
And the shame of that, that shame washed over me like the shame of sitting in front of the television, watching Peter Jennings announce the new millennium again and again and again
 I had been duped, hoodwinked, bamboozled
 But this time, the false savior was me
You see, I've come a long way from that altar on the night I thought the world would end, from a world where people spoke in tongues and saw suffering as a necessary act of God and took a text to be infallible truth
 Yes, I've come so far that I'm right back where I started
Because it simply is not true to say that we live in an age of disbelief -- no, we believe today just as much as any time that came before
 Some of us may believe in the prophecy of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins
 We may believe in the bible of The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review
 We may believe most deeply when we worship right here at the church of TED, but we desperately want to believe, we need to believe
 We speak in the tongues of charismatic leaders that promise to solve all our problems
 We see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalism that is our god, we take the text of technological progress to be infallible truth
 And we hardly realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one brick, because we fear it might shake our whole foundation
But if you are disturbed by the unconscionable things that we have come to accept, then it must be questioning time
 So I have not a gospel of disruption or innovation or a triple bottom line
 I do not have a gospel of faith to share with you today, in fact
 I have and I offer a gospel of doubt
 It is possible the answers we have are wrong, it is possible the questions themselves are wrong
 Yes, the gospel of doubt means that it is possible that we, on this stage, in this room, are wrong
 Because it raises the question, "Why?" With all the power that we hold in our hands, why are people still suffering so bad?
This doubt leads me to share that we are putting my organization, MBAs Across America, out of business
 We have shed our staff and closed our doors and we will share our model freely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our permission
 This doubt compels me to renounce the role of savior that some have placed on me, because our time is too short and our odds are too long to wait for second comings, when the truth is that there will be no miracles here
And this doubt, it fuels me, it gives me hope that when our troubles overwhelm us, when the paths laid out for us seem to lead to our demise, when our healers bring no comfort to our wounds, it will not be our blind faith -- no, it will be our humble doubt that shines a little light into the darkness of our lives and of our world and lets us raise our voice to whisper or to shout or to say simply, very simply, "There must be another way
"
Thank you
In case you are wondering, no, I'm not wearing a dress, and no, I'm not saying what I'm wearing underneath
This is a gho
 This is my national dress
 This is how all men dress in Bhutan
 That is how our women dress
 Like our women, we men get to wear pretty bright colors, but unlike our women, we get to show off our legs
But before I proceed, I should set you the context
 I should tell you our story
 We've been called Shangri-La, even the last Shangri-La
 But let me tell you right off the bat, we are not Shangri-La
 My country is not one big monastery populated with happy monks
The reality is that there are barely 700,000 of us sandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth, China and India
 But we are doing OK
 We are surviving
 In fact, we are thriving, and the reason we are thriving is because we've been blessed with extraordinary kings
 Our enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly to develop our country, balancing economic growth carefully with social development, environmental sustainability and cultural preservation, all within the framework of good governance
 We call this holistic approach to development "Gross National Happiness," or GNH
 Back in the 1970s, our fourth king famously pronounced that for Bhutan, Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product
Ever since, all development in Bhutan is driven by GNH, a pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness and well-being of our people
But that's easier said than done, especially when you are one of the smallest economies in the world
 Our entire GDP is less than two billion dollars
 I know that some of you here are worth more --
individually than the entire economy of my country
So our economy is small, but here is where it gets interesting
 Education is completely free
 Healthcare is also completely free
 Medical consultation, medical treatment, medicines: they are all provided by the state
 Our economy is small, and we must strengthen it
 Economic growth is important, but that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture or our pristine environment
Today, our culture is flourishing
 We continue to celebrate our art and architecture, food and festivals, monks and monasteries
 This is why I can wear my gho with pride
 Here's a fun fact: you're looking at the world's biggest pocket
It starts here, goes around the back, and comes out from inside here
 In this pocket we store all manner of personal goods from phones and wallets to iPads, office files and books
But sometimes -- sometimes even precious cargo
So our culture is flourishing, but so is our environment
 72 percent of my country is under forest cover
 Our constitution demands that a minimum of 60 percent of Bhutan's total land shall remain under forest cover for all time
Our constitution, this constitution, imposes forest cover on us
 Incidentally, our king used this constitution to impose democracy on us
 You see, we the people didn't want democracy
 We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it, and we certainly didn't fight for it
 Instead, our king imposed democracy on us by insisting that he include it in the constitution
 But he went further
 He included provisions in the constitution that empower the people to impeach their kings, and included provisions in here that require all our kings to retire at the age of 65
Fact is, we already have a king in retirement: our previous king, the Great Fourth, retired 10 years ago at the peak of his popularity
 He was all of 51 years at that time
So as I was saying, 72 percent of our country is under forest cover, and all that forest is pristine
 In a world that is threatened with climate change, we are a carbon neutral country
Turns out, it's a big deal
 Of the 200-odd countries in the world today, it looks like we are the only one that's carbon neutral
 Bhutan is not carbon neutral
 Bhutan is carbon negative
2 million tons of carbon dioxide, but our forests, they sequester more than three times that amount, so we are a net carbon sink for more than four million tons of carbon dioxide each year
 But that's not all
We export most of the renewable electricity we generate from our fast-flowing rivers
 So today, the clean energy that we export offsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood
 By 2020, we'll be exporting enough electricity to offset 17 million tons of carbon dioxide
 And if we were to harness even half our hydropower potential, and that's exactly what we are working at, the clean, green energy that we export would offset something like 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year
 That is more CO2 than what the entire city of New York generates in one year
So inside our country, we are a net carbon sink
 Outside, we are offsetting carbon
 And this is important stuff
 You see, the world is getting warmer, and climate change is a reality
 Climate change is affecting my country
 Our glaciers are melting, causing flash floods and landslides, which in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction in our country
 I was at that lake recently
 It's stunning
 That's how it looked 10 years ago, and that's how it looked 20 years ago
 It was a solid glacier
 That destruction was caused by one glacier lake
 We have 2,700 of them to contend with
 The point is this: my country and my people have done nothing to contribute to global warming, but we are already bearing the brunt of its consequences
 And for a small, poor country, one that is landlocked and mountainous, it is very difficult
 But we are not going to sit on our hands doing nothing
 We will fight climate change
 That's why we have promised to remain carbon neutral
 Governments were so busy arguing with one another and blaming each other for causing climate change, that when a small country raised our hands and announced, "We promise to remain carbon neutral for all time," nobody heard us
 Nobody cared
Last December in Paris, at COP 21, we reiterated our promise to remain carbon neutral for all time to come
 This time, we were heard
 We were noticed, and everybody cared
 All countries, from the very small to the very large, committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions
 The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change says that if these so-called intended commitments are kept, we'd be closer to containing global warming by two degrees Celsius
By the way, I've requested the TED organizers here to turn up the heat in here by two degrees, so if some of you are feeling warmer than usual, you know who to blame
It's crucial that all of us keep our commitments
 As far as Bhutan is concerned, we will keep our promise to remain carbon neutral
 Here are some of the ways we are doing it
 We are providing free electricity to our rural farmers
 The idea is that, with free electricity, they will no longer have to use firewood to cook their food
 We are investing in sustainable transport and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles
 Similarly, we are subsidizing the cost of LED lights, and our entire government is trying to go paperless
But it is our protected areas that are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy
 Our protected areas are our carbon sink
 Today, more than half our country is protected, as national parks, nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries
 But the beauty is that we've connected them all with one another through a network of biological corridors
 Now, what this means is that our animals are free to roam throughout our country
 Take this tiger, for example
 It was spotted at 250 meters above sea level in the hot, subtropical jungles
 Two years later, that same tiger was spotted near 4,000 meters in our cold alpine mountains
 Isn't that awesome?
We must keep it that way
 We must keep our parks awesome
But that is expensive
 Over the next few years, our small economy won't have the resources to cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment
 In fact, when we run the numbers, it looks like it'll take us at least 15 years before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts
 But neither Bhutan, nor the world can afford to spend 15 years going backwards
 Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need
 It gives us breathing room
 The idea is to raise a transition fund from individual donors, corporations and institutions, but the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met and all funds committed
 So multiparty, single closing: an idea we borrowed from Wall Street
 This means that individual donors can commit without having to worry that they'll be left supporting an underfunded plan
 It's something like a Kickstarter project, only with a 15-year time horizon and millions of tons of carbon dioxide at stake
 Once the deal is closed, we use the transition fund to protect our parks, giving our government time to increase our own funding gradually until the end of the 15-year period
 After that, our government guarantees full funding forever
We are almost there
 We expect to close later this year
The World Wildlife Fund is our principle partner in this journey, and I want to give them a big shoutout for the excellent work they are doing in Bhutan and across the world
Whew, it is getting warm in here
I thank you for listening to our story, a story of how we are keeping our promise to remain carbon neutral, a story of how we are keeping our country pristine, for ourselves, our children, for your children and for the world
 But we are not here to tell stories, are we? We are here to dream together
 What if we could mobilize our leadership and our resources, our influence and our passion, to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea to other countries so that they too can conserve their protected areas for all time
 They too have natural resources that can help win the world's fight for sustainability, only they may not have the ability to invest in them now
 So what if we set up Earth For Life, a global fund, to kickstart the Bhutan For Life throughout the world? I invite you to help me, to carry this dream beyond our borders to all those who care about our planet's future
 After all, we're here to dream together, to work together, to fight climate change together, to protect our planet together
 Because the reality is we are in it together
 Some of us might dress differently, but we are in it together
Thank you very much, and kadrin chhe la
 Thank you
Thank you, thank you, thank you
In India, we have these huge families
 I bet a lot of you all must have heard about it
 Which means that there are a lot of family events
 So as a child, my parents used to drag me to these family events
But the one thing that I always looked forward to was playing around with my cousins
 And there was always this one uncle who used to be there, always ready, jumping around with us, having games for us, making us kids have the time of our lives
 But then I saw this hale and hearty person deteriorate in health
 So this person, who used to be the center of attention in every family gathering, was suddenly hiding behind people
 He was hiding from the pitiful look in people's eyes
 Every year, 60,000 people are newly diagnosed with Parkinson's, and this number is only rising
 You can also target simple problems and create small solutions for them and eventually make a big impact
 So my aim here was to not cure Parkinson's, but to make their everyday tasks much more simple, and then make an impact
Well, the first thing I targeted was tremors, right? My uncle told me that he had stopped drinking coffee or tea in public just out of embarrassment, so, well, I designed the no-spill cup
 It works just purely on its form
 The curve on top deflects the liquid back inside every time they have tremors, and this keeps the liquid inside compared to a normal cup
 But the key here is that it is not tagged as a Parkinson's patient product
 So, well, one problem solved, many more to go
 But I really needed to dig deeper to get a new perspective
 And then, when I was actually observing him walking to his dining table, it struck me, this man who finds it so difficult to walk on flat land, how does he climb a staircase? Because in India we do not have a fancy rail that takes you up a staircase like in the developed countries
 One actually has to climb the stairs
" Let's take a look at what I saw
And the turns, he took them so easily
So -- shocked? Well, I was too
 So this person who could not walk on flat land was suddenly a pro at climbing stairs
On researching this, I realized that it's because it's a continuous motion
 There's this other man who also suffers from the same symptoms and uses a walker, but the moment he's put on a cycle, all his symptoms vanish, because it is a continuous motion
He walked faster, right?
I call this the staircase illusion, and actually when the staircase illusion abruptly ended, he froze, and this is called freezing of gait
 So it happens a lot, so why not have a staircase illusion flowing through all their rooms, making them feel much more confident? You know, technology is not always it
 I could have easily made it into a projection, or a Google Glass, or something like that
 But I stuck to simple print on the floor
 This print could be taken into hospitals to make them feel much more welcome
What I wish to do is make every Parkinson's patient feel like my uncle felt that day
 He told me that I made him feel like his old self again
"Smart" in today's world has become synonymous to high tech, and the world is only getting smarter and smarter day by day
 But why can't smart be something that's simple and yet effective? All we need is a little bit of empathy and some curiosity, to go out there, observe
 But let's not stop at that
 Let's find these complex problems
 Don't be scared of them
 Test these solutions, fail if needed, but with newer insights to make it better
 What would the world be like if we combined all our simple solutions? Let's make a smarter world, but with simplicity
Thank you
 The way I look back in the past is by using the fossilized remains of deepwater corals
 You can see an image of one of these corals behind me
So I'm hoping that this talk will give you a four-dimensional view of the ocean
 Two dimensions, such as this beautiful two-dimensional image of the sea surface temperature
 This was taken using satellite, so it's got tremendous spatial resolution
 The overall features are extremely easy to understand
 The equatorial regions are warm because there's more sunlight
 The polar regions are cold because there's less sunlight
 And that allows big icecaps to build up on Antarctica and up in the Northern Hemisphere
If we travel back in time 20,000 years ago, the earth looked very much different
 And I've just given you a cartoon version of one of the major differences you would have seen if you went back that long
 The icecaps were much bigger
 They covered lots of the continent, and they extended out over the ocean
 Sea level was 120 meters lower
 Carbon dioxide [levels] were very much lower than they are today
 So the earth was probably about three to five degrees colder overall, and much, much colder in the polar regions
What I'm trying to understand, and what other colleagues of mine are trying to understand, is how we moved from that cold climate condition to the warm climate condition that we enjoy today
 We know from ice core research that the transition from these cold conditions to warm conditions wasn't smooth, as you might predict from the slow increase in solar radiation
 And we know this from ice cores, because if you drill down into ice, you find annual bands of ice, and you can see this in the iceberg
 You can see those blue-white layers
 Sometimes it increased very rapidly, then there was a plateau, then it increased rapidly
 It was different in the two polar regions, and CO2 also increased in jumps
So we're pretty sure the ocean has a lot to do with this
 The ocean stores huge amounts of carbon, about 60 times more than is in the atmosphere
 It also acts to transport heat across the equator, and the ocean is full of nutrients and it controls primary productivity
So if we want to find out what's going on down in the deep sea, we really need to get down there, see what's there and start to explore
 This is some spectacular footage coming from a seamount about a kilometer deep in international waters in the equatorial Atlantic, far from land
 You're amongst the first people to see this bit of the seafloor, along with my research team
 You're probably seeing new species
 We don't know
 You'd have to collect the samples and do some very intense taxonomy
 You can see beautiful bubblegum corals
 There are brittle stars growing on these corals
 Those are things that look like tentacles coming out of corals
 There are corals made of different forms of calcium carbonate growing off the basalt of this massive undersea mountain, and the dark sort of stuff, those are fossilized corals, and we're going to talk a little more about those as we travel back in time
To do that, we need to charter a research boat
 This is the James Cook, an ocean-class research vessel moored up in Tenerife
 This is us trying to make sure that we don't lose precious samples
So we've got to become a really good mapper to do this
 You don't see that kind of spectacular coral abundance everywhere
 It is global and it is deep, but we need to really find the right places
 We just saw a global map, and overlaid was our cruise passage from last year
 This was a seven-week cruise, and this is us, having made our own maps of about 75,000 square kilometers of the seafloor in seven weeks, but that's only a tiny fraction of the seafloor
 We're traveling from west to east, over part of the ocean that would look featureless on a big-scale map, but actually some of these mountains are as big as Everest
 So with the maps that we make on board, we get about 100-meter resolution, enough to pick out areas to deploy our equipment, but not enough to see very much
 To do that, we need to fly remotely-operated vehicles about five meters off the seafloor
 And if we do that, we can get maps that are one-meter resolution down thousands of meters
 Here is a remotely-operated vehicle, a research-grade vehicle
 You can see an array of big lights on the top
 There are high-definition cameras, manipulator arms, and lots of little boxes and things to put your samples
Here we are on our first dive of this particular cruise, plunging down into the ocean
 We go pretty fast to make sure the remotely operated vehicles are not affected by any other ships
 And we go down, and these are the kinds of things you see
 This is a swimming holothurian -- it's a small sea slug, basically
 This is slowed down
 Most of the footage I'm showing you is speeded up, because all of this takes a lot of time
 This is a beautiful holothurian as well
 And this animal you're going to see coming up was a big surprise
 I've never seen anything like this and it took us all a bit surprised
 This was after about 15 hours of work and we were all a bit trigger-happy, and suddenly this giant sea monster started rolling past
 This wasn't what we were looking for
 We were looking for corals, deep sea corals
 You're going to see a picture of one in a moment
 It's small, about five centimeters high
 It's made of calcium carbonate, so you can see its tentacles there, moving in the ocean currents
 An organism like this probably lives for about a hundred years
 And as it grows, it takes in chemicals from the ocean
 And if we can understand how these chemicals get into the skeleton, we can then go back, collect fossil specimens, and reconstruct what the ocean used to look like in the past
 And here you can see us collecting that coral with a vacuum system, and we put it into a sampling container
 We can do this very carefully, I should add
Some of these organisms live even longer
 Four thousand years is a long time
 If you take a branch from one of these corals and polish it up, this is about 100 microns across
 And Brendan took some analyses across this coral -- you can see the marks -- and he's been able to show that these are actual annual bands, so even at 500 meters deep in the ocean, corals can record seasonal changes, which is pretty spectacular
But 4,000 years is not enough to get us back to our last glacial maximum
 So what do we do? We go in for these fossil specimens
 This is what makes me really unpopular with my research team
 And we pick up all these corals, bring them back, we sort them out
 But each one of these is a different age, and if we can find out how old they are and then we can measure those chemical signals, this helps us to find out what's been going on in the ocean in the past
So on the left-hand image here, I've taken a slice through a coral, polished it very carefully and taken an optical image
 Why are we doing this? Uranium is a very poorly regarded element, but I love it
 The decay helps us find out about the rates and dates of what's going on in the ocean
 And if you remember from the beginning, that's what we want to get at when we're thinking about climate
 So we use a laser to analyze uranium and one of its daughter products, thorium, in these corals, and that tells us exactly how old the fossils are
This beautiful animation of the Southern Ocean I'm just going to use illustrate how we're using these corals to get at some of the ancient ocean feedbacks
 You can see the density of the surface water in this animation by Ryan Abernathey
 It's just one year of data, but you can see how dynamic the Southern Ocean is
 The intense mixing, particularly the Drake Passage, which is shown by the box, is really one of the strongest currents in the world coming through here, flowing from west to east
 It's very turbulently mixed, because it's moving over those great big undersea mountains, and this allows CO2 and heat to exchange with the atmosphere in and out
 We've collected corals from back and forth across this Antarctic passage, and we've found quite a surprising thing from my uranium dating: the corals migrated from south to north during this transition from the glacial to the interglacial
 We don't really know why, but we think it's something to do with the food source and maybe the oxygen in the water
So here we are
 I'm going to illustrate what I think we've found about climate from those corals in the Southern Ocean
 We collected little fossil corals
 This is my illustration of that
 That stops carbon dioxide coming out of the ocean
 We then found corals that are of an intermediate age, and they show us that the ocean mixed partway through that climate transition
 That allows carbon to come out of the deep ocean
 And then if we analyze corals closer to the modern day, or indeed if we go down there today anyway and measure the chemistry of the corals, we see that we move to a position where carbon can exchange in and out
 So this is the way we can use fossil corals to help us learn about the environment
So I want to leave you with this last slide
 It's just a still taken out of that first piece of footage that I showed you
 We didn't even expect to find things this beautiful
 It's thousands of meters deep
 There are new species
 There are fossils in amongst, and now I've trained you to appreciate the fossil corals that are down there
So next time you're lucky enough to fly over the ocean or sail over the ocean, just think -- there are massive sea mountains down there that nobody's ever seen before, and there are beautiful corals
Thank you
Food crisis
 It's in the news every day
 But what is it?
Some places in the world it's too little food, maybe too much
 Maybe GMO is the problem? Too much agricultural runoff creating bad oceans, toxic oceans, attenuation of nutrition
 They go on and on
 And I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly disempowering
 So how do we bring that to something that we understand?
How is this apple food crisis? You've all eaten an apple in the last week, I'm sure
 How old do you think it was from when it was picked? Two weeks? Two months? Eleven months -- the average age of an apple in a grocery store in the United States
 And I don't expect it to be much different in Europe or anywhere else in the world
 We pick them, we put them in cold storage, we gas the cold storage -- there's actually documented proof of workers trying to go into these environments to retrieve an apple, and dying, because the atmosphere that they slow down the process of the apple with is also toxic to humans
How is it that none of you knew this? Why didn't I know this? Ninety percent of the quality of that apple -- all of the antioxidants -- are gone by the time we get it
 It's basically a little ball of sugar
 How did we get so information poor and how can we do better?
I think what's missing is a platform
 I know platforms -- I know computers, they put me on the Internet when I was young
 I did very weird things --
on this platform
 But I met people, and I could express myself
How do you express yourself in food? If we had a platform, we might feel empowered to question: What if? For me, I questioned: What if climate was democratic? So, this is a map of climate in the world
 The most productive areas in green, the least productive in red
 They shift and they change, and Californian farmers now become Mexican farmers
 China picks up land in Brazil to grow better food, and we're a slave to climate
 What if each country had its own productive climate? What would that change about how we live? What would that change about quality of life and nutrition?
The last generation's problem was, we need more food and we need it cheap
 All these traces -- these are cars, planes, trains and automobiles
 It's a miracle that we feed seven billion people with just a few of us involved in the production of food
What if 
 we built a digital farm? A digital world farm
["Japanese farming has no youth, no water, no land and no future
"]
That's what I landed to the day that I went to Minamisanriku, one stop south of Fukushima, after the disaster
 But it's not unique to Japan
 Two percent of the American population is involved in farming
 What good answer comes from two percent of any population? As we go around the world, 50 percent of the African population is under 18
 Eighty percent don't want to be farmers
 Farming is hard
 The life of a small-shareholder farmer is miserable
 They go into the city
 It's uncomfortable to talk about
 Where are they going? Into the city
 No young people, and everyone's headed in
Welcome to the new tractor
 This is my combine
 A number of years ago now, I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot and I started hacking
 And I created one of the most intimate relationships I've ever had in my life, because I was learning the language of plants
 I wanted to make it bigger
With my team, we built a farm inside of the media lab, a place historically known not for anything about biology but everything about digital life
 Inside of these 60 square feet, we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month -- not a lot of food
 And there's a lot of interesting technology in there
 Is this a new cafeteria? Is this a new retail experience? Is this a new grocery store? I can tell you one thing for sure: this is the first time anybody in the media lab ripped the roots off of anything
We get our salad in bags; there's nothing wrong with that
 But what happens when you have an image-based processing expert, a data scientist, a roboticist, ripping roots off and thinking, "Huh
In that process we would bring the plants out and we would take some back to the lab, because if you grew it, you don't throw it away; it's kind of precious to you
 I have this weird tongue now, because I'm afraid to let anybody eat anything until I've eaten it first, because I want it to be good
1
1 -- no, no, you can't eat it today
"
 Technologists falling backwards into plant physiology
So we thought other people needed to be able to try this
 We want to see what people can create, so we conceived of a lab that could be shipped anywhere
 And then we built it
So on the facade of the media lab is my lab, that has about 30 points of sensing per plant
 If you know about the genome or genetics, this is the phenome, right? The phenomena
 When you say, "I like the strawberries from Mexico," you really like the strawberries from the climate that produced the expression that you like
 So if you're coding climate -- this much CO2, this much O2 creates a recipe -- you're coding the expression of that plant, the nutrition of that plant, the size of that plant, the shape, the color, the texture
 We need data, so we put a bunch of sensors in there to tell us what's going on
If you think of your houseplants, and you look at your houseplant and you're super sad, because you're like, "Why are you dying? Won't you talk to me?"
Farmers develop the most beautiful fortune-telling eyes by the time they're in their late 60s and 70s
 Those beautiful eyes are not being passed down
These are eyes in the cloud of a farmer
 We trend those data points over time
 We correlate those data points to individual plants
We have IP-addressable broccoli
So if that's not weird enough, you can click one and you get a plant profile
 And what this tells you is downloadable progress on that plant, but not like you'd think, it's not just when it's ready
 When does it achieve the nutrition that I need? When does it achieve the taste that I desire? Is it getting too much water? Is it getting too much sun? Alerts
 It can talk to me, it's conversant, we have a language
I think of that as the first user on the plant Facebook, right? That's a plant profile and that plant will start making friends
 We're going to learn about a complexity that we can only guess at now
So this is my lab now
 It's a little bit more systematized, my background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things, so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment
 This process, aeroponics, was developed by NASA for Mir Space Station for reducing the amount of water they send into space
 What it really does is give the plant exactly what it wants: water, minerals and oxygen
 Roots are not that complicated, so when you give them that, you get this amazing expression
 It's like the plant has two hearts
 And because it has two hearts, it grows four or five times faster
 It's a perfect world
So we've grown all kinds of things
 Do you know that we have rare and ancient seed banks? Banks of seed
 It's amazing
 They have germplasm alive and things that you've never eaten
 I am the only person in this room that's eaten that kind of tomato
 Problem is it was a sauce tomato and we don't know how to cook, so we ate a sauce tomato, which is not that great
 We've grown humans --
Well maybe you could, but we didn't
But what we realized is, the tool was too big, it was too expensive
 I was starting to put them around the world and they were about 100,000 dollars
 Finding somebody with 100 grand in their back pocket isn't easy, so we wanted to make a small one
This project was actually one of my student's -- mechanical engineering undergraduate, Camille
 So Camille and I and my team, we iterated all summer, how to make it cheaper, how to make it work better, how to make it so other people can make it
 Then we dropped them off in schools, seventh through eleventh grade
 And if you want to be humbled, try to teach a kid something
So I went into this school and I said, "Set it to 65 percent humidity
"
The seventh grader said, "What's humidity?"
And I said, "Oh, it's water in air
"
He said, "There's no water in air, you're an idiot
"
And I was like, "Alright, don't trust me
 Actually -- don't trust me, right? Set it to 100
 Humidity is rain
 Why didn't you just tell me that?"
 They have a 3D environment, they can log into it anywhere in the world on their smartphone, on their tablet
 They have different parts of the bots -- the physical, the sensors
 They select recipes that have been created by other kids anywhere in the world
 They select and activate that recipe, they plant a seedling
" Crank up CO2, plant dies
 Or crank down CO2, plant does very well
 Harvest plant, and you've created a new digital recipe
It's an iterative design and development and exploration process
 They can download, then, all of the data about that new plant that they developed or the new digital recipe and what did it do -- was it better or was it worse? Imagine these as little cores of processing
 We're going to learn so much
 This is three weeks of growth
 But more importantly, it was the first time that this kid ever thought he could be a farmer -- or that he would want to be a farmer
So, we've open-sourced all of this
 It's all online; go home, try to build your first food computer
 It's going to be difficult -- I'm just telling you
 We're in the beginning, but it's all there
 It's very important to me that this is easily accessible
 We're going to keep making it more so
These are farmers, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, environmental engineer, computer scientist, plant scientist, economist, urban planners
 On one platform, doing what they're good at
 But we got a little too big
This is my new facility that I'm just starting
 This warehouse could be anywhere
 That's why I chose it
 And inside of this warehouse we're going to build something kind of like this
 These exist right now
 Take a look at it
 These exist, too
 One grows greens, one grows Ebola vaccine
 Pretty amazing that plants and this DARPA Grand Challenge winner is one of the reasons we're getting ahead of Ebola
 So pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, all they way down to lettuce
But these two things look nothing alike, and that's where I am with my field
 Everything is different
 Don't buy his, buy mine
"
And the reality is, we're just at the beginning, in a time when society is shifting, too
 And when you have McDonald's advertising what's in the Chicken McNugget, the most mysterious food item of all time -- they are now basing their marketing plan on that -- everything is changing
So into the world now
 Personal food computers, food servers and food data centers run on the open phenome
 Think open genome, but we're going to put little climate recipes, like Wikipedia, that you can pull down, actuate and grow
 This is not just my fantasy, this is where we're already deploying
 Food computers, food servers, soon-to-be food data centers, connecting people together to share information
The future of food is not about fighting over what's wrong with this
 We know what's wrong with this
 The future of food is about networking the next one billion farmers and empowering them with a platform to ask and answer the question, "What if?"
Thank you
So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid
 I ran for Congress
For years, I had existed safely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run
 The sitting congresswoman had been in my district since 1992
 She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her in a Democratic primary
 The polls, however, told a very different story
 My pollsters told me that I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win
But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race
 I swore I was going to win
 I had the endorsement from the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal snapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country
 I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy an Indian girl was running
 But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers that said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1
3 million dollars on 6,321 votes
 Don't do the math
 It was humiliating
Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk about the importance of failure
 Nor is it about leaning in
 I tell you the story of how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time in my entire life that I had done something that was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect
 so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate towards careers and professions that they know they're going to be great in, that they know they're going to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why
 Most girls are taught to avoid risk and failure
 We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's
 Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off headfirst
 And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated to take risk after risk
 They're rewarded for it
 It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously unless you've had two failed start-ups
Some people worry about our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit
 Our economy, our society, we're just losing out because we're not raising our girls to be brave
 The bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look
In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment that was too difficult for them
 She found that bright girls were quick to give up
 The higher the IQ, the more likely they were to give up
 Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material to be a challenge
 They found it energizing
 They were more likely to redouble their efforts
What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys in every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability
 The difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge
 An HP report found that men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent of the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent of the qualifications
 100 percent
 But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious
 And so those 600,000 jobs that are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy is being left behind on all the innovation and problems women would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect
So in 2012, I started a company to teach girls to code, and what I found is that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave
 Coding, it's an endless process of trial and error, of trying to get the right command in the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference between success and failure
 Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying to build comes to life
 It requires perseverance
 It requires imperfection
We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect
 Every Girls Who Code teacher tells me the same story
 During the first week, when the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over and she'll say, "I don't know what code to write
" The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor
 If she didn't know any better, she'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes just staring at the screen
 But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student wrote code and then deleted it
 She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right
 Instead of showing the progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all
 Perfection or bust
It turns out that our girls are really good at coding, but it's not enough just to teach them to code
My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor at the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours with computer science students
 When the guys are struggling with an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, "Professor, there's something wrong with my code
" The girls will come in and say, "Professor, there's something wrong with me
"
We have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it with building a sisterhood that lets girls know that they are not alone
 Because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system
 I can't tell you how many women tell me,
 When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network cheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day
 Take, for instance, two of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming
 Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love for her new country by building an app to help Americans get to the polls
 Or a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant in the off chance that she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer
 These are just three examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying, who have learned perseverance
 And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams
And those dreams have never been more important for our country
 For the American economy, for any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind half our population
 We have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now
 We cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old
 We have to teach them to be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential to impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous
 And so I need each of you to tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece, your employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach girls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement of young women who are brave and who will build a better world for themselves and for each and every one of us
Thank you
 Thank you
 Reshma, thank you
 It's such a powerful vision you have
 You have a vision
 Tell me how it's going
 How many girls are involved now in your program?
 So in 2012, we taught 20 girls
 This year we'll teach 40,000 in all 50 states
And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science
 And you're working with some of the companies in this room even, who are welcoming graduates from your program?
 Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there
 And if you're not signed up, I'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code classroom in their office
 And you have some stories back from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams, good things happen
 Great things happen
 I mean, I think that it's crazy to me to think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all consumer purchases are made by women
 Women use social media at a rate of 600 percent more than men
 We own the Internet, and we should be building the companies of tomorrow
 And I think when companies have diverse teams, and they have incredible women that are part of their engineering teams, they build awesome things, and we see it every day
 Reshma, you saw the reaction there
 You're doing incredibly important work
 This whole community is cheering you on
 Thank you
 Thank you
Today I wanted to -- well, this morning -- I want to talk about the future of human-driven transportation; about how we can cut congestion, pollution and parking by getting more people into fewer cars; and how we can do it with the technology that's in our pockets
 And yes, I'm talking about smartphones 
 not self-driving cars
But to get started we've got to go back over 100 years
 Because it turns out there was an Uber way before Uber
So let me introduce you to the jitney
 In 1914 it was created or invented by a guy named LP Draper
 He was a car salesman from LA, and he had an idea
 Well, he was cruising around downtown Los Angeles, my hometown, and he saw trolleys with long lines of people trying to get to where they wanted to go
 He said, well, why don't I just put a sign on my car that takes people wherever they want to go for a jitney -- that was slang for a nickel
 And within one year, by 1915, there were 50,000 rides per day in Seattle, 45,000 rides per day in Kansas and 150,000 rides per day in Los Angeles
 To give you some perspective, Uber in Los Angeles is doing 157,000 rides per day, today 
And so these are the trolley guys, the existing transportation monopoly at the time
 They were clearly not happy about the jitney juggernaut
 And so they got to work and they went to cities across the country and got regulations put in place to slow down the growth of the jitney
And there were all kinds of regulations
 There were licenses -- often they were pricey
 In some cities, if you were a jitney driver, you were required to be in the jitney for 16 hours a day
 In other cities, they required two jitney drivers for one jitney
 But there was a really interesting regulation which was they had to put a backseat light -- install it in every Jitney -- to stop a new pernicious innovation which they called spooning
All right
 But the jitney, by 1919, was regulated completely out of existence
That's unfortunate 
 because, well, when you can't share a car, then you have to own one
 And car ownership skyrocketed and it's no wonder that by 2007, there was a car for every man, woman and child in the United States
 In China by 2011, there were more car sales happening in China than in the US
Now, all this private ownership of course had a public cost
 In the US, we spend 7 billion hours a year, wasted, sitting in traffic
Now, that's only four percent of our problem though
 Because if you have to own a car then that means 96 percent of the time your car is sitting idle
 And so, up to 30 percent of our land and our space is used storing these hunks of steel
 We even have skyscrapers built for cars
 That's the world we live in today
Now, cities have been dealing with this problem for decades
 It's called mass transit
 And even in a city like New York City, one of the most densely populated in the world and one of the most sophisticated mass transit systems in the world, there are still 2
 Why is that? Well, it's because mass transit hasn't yet figured out how to get to everybody's doorstep
 And so back in San Francisco, where I live, the situation's much worse, in fact, much worse around the world
And so the beginning of Uber in 2010 was -- well, we just wanted to push a button and get a ride
 We didn't have any grand ambitions
 But it just turned out that lots of people wanted to push a button and get a ride, and ultimately what we started to see was a lot of duplicate rides
 We saw a lot of people pushing the same button at the same time going essentially to the same place
And so we started thinking about, well, how do we make those two trips and turn them into one
 Because if we did, that ride would be a lot cheaper -- up to 50 percent cheaper -- and of course for the city you've got a lot more people and a lot fewer cars
And so the big question for us was: would it work? Could you have a cheaper ride cheap enough that people would be willing to share it? And the answer, fortunately, is a resounding yes
In San Francisco, before uberPOOL, we had -- well, everybody would take their car wherever the heck they wanted
 And the bright colors is where we have the most cars
 And once we introduced uberPOOL, well, you see there's not as many bright colors
 More people getting around the city in fewer cars, taking cars off the road
 It looks like uberPOOL is working
 And since then, we've taken 7
9 million miles off the roads and we've taken 1
4 thousand metric tons of CO2 out of the air
But my favorite statistic -- remember, I'm from LA, I spent years of my life sitting behind the wheel, going, "How do we fix this?" -- my favorite part is that eight months later, we have added 100,000 new people that are carpooling every week
 And of course we're seeing that exponential growth happen
 In fact, we're seeing it in LA, too
 And when I talk to my team, we don't talk about, "Hey, well, 100,000 people carpooling every week and we're done
" How do we get that to a million? And in China, well, that could be several million
And so uberPOOL is a very great solution for urban carpooling
 But what about the suburbs?
This is the street where I grew up in Los Angeles, it's actually a suburb called Northridge, California, and, well -- look, those mailboxes, they kind of just go on forever
 And every morning at about the same time, cars roll of out their driveway, most of them, one person in the car, and they go to work, they go to their place of work
Well, we have something for this that we recently launched called uberCOMMUTE
 You get up in the morning, get ready for work, get your coffee, go to your car and you light up the Uber app, and all of a sudden, you become an Uber driver
 And we'll match you up with one of your neighbors on your way to work and it's a really great thing
There's just one hitch 
 it's called regulation
 You can pick up anybody in the United States and take them wherever they want to go at a moment's notice, for 54 cents a mile or less
 But if you charge 60 cents a mile, you're a criminal
 But what if for 60 cents a mile we could get half a million more people carpooling in Los Angeles? And what if at 60 cents a mile we could get 50 million people carpooling in the United States? If we could, it's obviously something we should do
And so it goes back to the lesson of the jitney
 If by 1915 this thing was taking off, imagine without the regulations that happened, if that thing could just keep going
 How would our cities be different today? Would we have parks in the place of parking lots? Well, we lost that chance
 But technology has given us another opportunity
Now, I'm as excited as anybody else about self-driving cars but do we have to really wait five, 10 or even 20 years to make our new cities a reality? With the technology in our pockets today, and a little smart regulation, we can turn every car into a shared car, and we can reclaim our cities starting today
Thank you
 Travis, thank you
 Thank you
 You know -- I mean the company you've built is absolutely astounding
 You only just talked about a small part of it here -- a powerful part -- the idea of turning cars into public transport like that, it's cool
 But I've got a couple other questions because I know they're out there on people's minds
 You had this very radical, very bold, brave redesign
 Sure
 How did it go? Did you notice other people not finding the app that day? Are you going to win people over for this redesign?
 And I think if you know a little bit about our history, it makes a lot more sense
 Which is, when we first got started, it was just black cars
 It was literally you push a button and get an S-Class
 And so what we did was almost what I would call an immature version of a luxury brand that looked like a badge on a luxury car
And as we've gone worldwide and gone from S-Classes to auto rickshaws in India, it became something that was important for us to be more accessible, to be more hyperlocal, to be about the cities we were in and that's what you see with the patterns and colors
 And so that was a little bit what it was about
Now, when you first roll out something like that, I mean, your hands are sweating, you've got -- you know, you're a little worried
 What we saw is a lot of people -- actually, at the beginning, we saw a lot more people opening the app because they were curious what they would find when they opened it
 And our numbers were slightly up from what we expected
 OK, that's cool
Now, so you, yourself, are something of an enigma, I would say
 Your supporters and investors, who have been with you the whole way, believe that the only chance of sort of taking on the powerful, entrenched interests of taxi industry and so forth, is to have someone who is a fierce, relentless competitor, which you've certainly proved to be
Some people feel you've almost taken that culture too far, and you know -- like a year or two ago there was a huge controversy where a lot of women got upset
 How did it feel like inside the company during that period? Did you notice a loss of business? Did you learn anything from that?
 Well, look, I think -- I've been an entrepreneur since I've been in high school and you have -- In various different ways an entrepreneur will see hard times and for us, it was about a year and a half ago, and for us it was hard times, too
 And so there was a lot that we had to do to sort of -- We'd gone from a very small company -- I mean if you go literally two and a half years ago, our company was 400 people, and today it's 6,500
 And so when you go through that growth, you have to sort of cement your cultural values and talk about them all of the time
 And make sure that people are constantly checking to say, "Are we good people doing good work?" And if you check those boxes, the next part of that is making sure you're telling your story
 And I think we learned a lot of lessons but I think at the end of it we came out stronger
 But it was certainly a difficult period
 Some Uber drivers in New York and elsewhere are mad as hell now because you changed the fees and they can barely -- they claim -- barely afford the deal anymore
How -- You know, you said that you started this originally -- just the coolness of pressing a button and summoning a ride
 This thing's taken off, you're affecting the whole global economy, basically, at this point
 You're being forced to be, whether you want it or not, a kind of global visionary who's changing the world
 I mean -- who are you? Do you want that? Are you ready to go with that and be what that takes?
 Well, there's a few things packed in that question, so --
First is on the pricing side -- I mean, keep in mind, right? UberX, when we first started, was literally 10 or 15 percent cheaper than our black car product
 It's now in many cities, half the price of a taxi
 And we have all the data to show that the divers are making more per hour than they would as taxi drivers
What happens is when the price goes down, people are more likely to take Uber at different times of the day than they otherwise would have, and they're more likely to use it in places they wouldn't have before
 And what that means for a driver is wherever he or she drops somebody off, they're much more likely to get a pickup and get back in
 And so what that means is more trips per hour, more minutes of the hour where they're productive and actually, earnings come up
And we have cities where we've done literally five or six price cuts and have seen those price cuts go up over time
 Same month every year
 And there's a perfect price point -- you can't go down forever
 And in those places where we bring the price down but we don't see those earnings pop, we bring the prices back up
So that addresses that first part
 And then the enigma and all of this -- I mean, the kind of entrepreneur I am is one that gets really excited about solving hard problems
 And the way I like to describe it is it's kind of like a math professor
 And so at Uber we like the hard problems and we like getting excited about those and solving them
 In a couple years' time -- say five years' time, I don't know when -- you roll out your incredible self-driving cars, at probably a lower cost than you currently pay for an Uber ride
 What do you say to your army of a million drivers plus at that time?
 At the time when self-driving cars are coming --
 Sure, sure, sure
 What do you say to a driver? TK: Well, look, I think the first part is it's going to take -- it's likely going to take a lot longer than I think some of the hype or media might expect
 That's part one
Part two is it's going to also take -- there's going to be a long transition
 These cars will work in certain places and not in others
For us it's an interesting challenge, right? Because, well -- Google's been investing in this since 2007, Tesla's going to be doing it, Apple's going to be doing it, the manufacturers are going to be doing it
 This is a world that's going to exist, and for good reason
 A million people die a year in cars
 And think about the quality of life that improves when you give people their time back and it's not so anxiety-ridden
 So I think there's a lot of good
But how do we optimistically lead through it? Are there ways to partner with cities? Are there ways to have education systems, vocational training, etc
, for that transition period
 But it is a world that's going to exist, and it is going to be a better world
 Travis, what you're building is absolutely incredible and I'm hugely grateful to you for coming to TED and sharing so openly
Thank you so much
 TK: Thank you very much
There are times when I feel really quite ashamed to be a European
 In the last year, more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help, and our response, frankly, has been pathetic
There are just so many contradictions
 We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Kurdi, and yet, since then, more than 200 children have subsequently drowned in the Mediterranean
 We have labor shortages, and yet we exclude people who fit our economic and demographic needs from coming to Europe
 We proclaim our liberal values in opposition to fundamentalist Islam, and yet -- we have repressive policies that detain child asylum seekers, that separate children from their families, and that seize property from refugees
What are we doing? How has the situation come to this, that we've adopted such an inhumane response to a humanitarian crisis?
 I believe it's because our politicians lack a vision, a vision for how to adapt an international refugee system created over 50 years ago for a changing and globalized world
 And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two really fundamental questions, the two questions we all need to ask
 First, why is the current system not working? And second, what can we do to fix it?
So the modern refugee regime was created in the aftermath of the Second World War by these guys
 Its basic aim is to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people, people have somewhere to go, to live in safety and dignity until they can go home
 It was created precisely for situations like the situation we see in Syria today
 Through an international convention signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees, and an international organization, UNHCR, states committed to reciprocally admit people onto their territory who flee conflict and persecution
But today, that system is failing
 In theory, refugees have a right to seek asylum
 In theory, refugees have a right to a pathway to integration, or return to the country they've come from
 But in practice, they get stuck in almost indefinite limbo
 In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility
 In practice, geography means that countries proximate the conflict take the overwhelming majority of the world's refugees
 The system isn't broken because the rules are wrong
 It's that we're not applying them adequately to a changing world, and that's what we need to reconsider
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works
 How does the refugee regime actually work? But not from a top-down institutional perspective, rather from the perspective of a refugee
 So imagine a Syrian woman
 And Amira to me represents many of the people I've met in the region
 And so Amira can't go back there
 But Amira also has no hope of resettlement to a third country, because that's a lottery ticket only available to less than one percent of the world's refugees
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice
 They have three basic options
 The first option is that Amira can take her family to a camp
 In the camp, she might get assistance, but there are very few prospects for Amira and her family
 Camps are in bleak, arid locations, often in the desert
 In the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear the shells across the border in Syria at nighttime
 Education is often of poor quality
 It's a miserable existence, and that's probably why, in reality, only nine percent of Syrians choose that option
Alternatively, Amira can head to an urban area in a neighboring country, like Amman or Beirut
 That's an option that about 75 percent of Syrian refugees have taken
 They don't usually get significant access to assistance
 And so when Amira and her family have used up their basic savings, they're left with very little and likely to face urban destitution
 Amira can seek some hope for her family by risking their lives on a dangerous and perilous journey to another country, and it's that which we're seeing in Europe today
Around the world, we present refugees with an almost impossible choice between three options: encampment, urban destitution and dangerous journeys
 For refugees, that choice is the global refugee regime today
 But I think it's a false choice
 The reason why we limit those options is because we think that those are the only options that are available to refugees, and they're not
 Politicians frame the issue as a zero-sum issue, that if we benefit refugees, we're imposing costs on citizens
 We tend to have a collective assumption that refugees are an inevitable cost or burden to society
 But they don't have to
 They can contribute
So what I want to argue is there are ways in which we can expand that choice set and still benefit everyone else: the host states and communities, our societies and refugees themselves
 And I want to suggest four ways we can transform the paradigm of how we think about refugees
 All four ways have one thing in common: they're all ways in which we take the opportunities of globalization, mobility and markets, and update the way we think about the refugee issue
The first one I want to think about is the idea of enabling environments, and it starts from a very basic recognition that refugees are human beings like everyone else, but they're just in extraordinary circumstances
 Together with my colleagues in Oxford, we've embarked on a research project in Uganda looking at the economic lives of refugees
 We chose Uganda not because it's representative of all host countries
 It's not
 It's exceptional
 Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunity
 It gives them the right to work
 And the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community
 In the capital city, Kampala, we found that 21 percent of refugees own a business that employs other people, and 40 percent of those employees are nationals of the host country
 In other words, refugees are making jobs for citizens of the host country
 Even in the camps, we found extraordinary examples of vibrant, flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses
For example, in a settlement called Nakivale, we found examples of Congolese refugees running digital music exchange businesses
 We found a Rwandan who runs a business that's available to allow the youth to play computer games on recycled games consoles and recycled televisions
 Demou-Kay arrived in the settlement with very little, but he wanted to be a filmmaker
 So with friends and colleagues, he started a community radio station, he rented a video camera, and he's now making films
 He made two documentary films with and for our team, and he's making a successful business out of very little
 It's those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refugees
 Rather than seeing refugees as inevitably dependent upon humanitarian assistance, we need to provide them with opportunities for human flourishing
Yes, clothes, blankets, shelter, food are all important in the emergency phase, but we need to also look beyond that
 We need to provide opportunities to connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, access to capital and banking
 All the ways in which we take for granted that we are plugged in to the global economy can and should apply to refugees
The second idea I want to discuss is economic zones
 Unfortunately, not every host country in the world takes the approach Uganda has taken
 Most host countries don't open up their economies to refugees in the same way
Last April, I traveled to Jordan with my colleague, the development economist Paul Collier, and we brainstormed an idea while we were there with the international community and the government, an idea to bring jobs to Syrians while supporting Jordan's national development strategy
 The idea is for an economic zone, one in which we could potentially integrate the employment of refugees alongside the employment of Jordanian host nationals
 And just 15 minutes away from the Zaatari refugee camp, home to 83,000 refugees, is an existing economic zone called the King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area
 The government has spent over a hundred million dollars connecting it to the electricity grid, connecting it to the road network, but it lacked two things: access to labor and inward investment
 So what if refugees were able to work there rather than being stuck in camps, able to support their families and develop skills through vocational training before they go back to Syria? We recognized that that could benefit Jordan, whose development strategy requires it to make the leap as a middle income country to manufacturing
 It could benefit refugees, but it could also contribute to the postconflict reconstruction of Syria by recognizing that we need to incubate refugees as the best source of eventually rebuilding Syria
We published the idea in the journal Foreign Affairs
 King Abdullah has picked up on the idea
The third idea that I want to put to you is preference matching between states and refugees to lead to the kinds of happy outcomes you see here in the selfie featuring Angela Merkel and a Syrian refugee
 What we rarely do is ask refugees what they want, where they want to go, but I'd argue we can do that and still make everyone better off
 The economist Alvin Roth has developed the idea of matching markets, ways in which the preference ranking of the parties shapes an eventual match
 My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Teytelboym have explored ways in which that idea could be applied to refugees, to ask refugees to rank their preferred destinations, but also allow states to rank the types of refugees they want on skills criteria or language criteria and allow those to match
 Now, of course you'd need to build in quotas on things like diversity and vulnerability, but it's a way of increasing the possibilities of matching
 The matching idea has been successfully used to match, for instance, students with university places, to match kidney donors with patients, and it underlies the kind of algorithms that exist on dating websites
 So why not apply that to give refugees greater choice?
 And at the moment, in my country, for instance, we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities, which makes no sense at all
 So matching markets offer a potential way to bring those preferences together and listen to the needs and demands of the populations that host and the refugees themselves
The fourth idea I want to put to you is of humanitarian visas
 Much of the tragedy and chaos we've seen in Europe was entirely avoidable
 It stems from a fundamental contradiction in Europe's asylum policy, which is the following: that in order to seek asylum in Europe, you have to arrive spontaneously by embarking on those dangerous journeys that I described
 But why should those journeys be necessary in an era of the budget airline and modern consular capabilities? They're completely unnecessary journeys, and last year, they led to the deaths of over 3,000 people on Europe's borders and within European territory
If refugees were simply allowed to travel directly and seek asylum in Europe, we would avoid that, and there's a way of doing that through something called a humanitarian visa, that allows people to collect a visa at an embassy or a consulate in a neighboring country and then simply pay their own way through a ferry or a flight to Europe
 It costs around a thousand euros to take a smuggler from Turkey to the Greek islands
 It costs 200 euros to take a budget airline from Bodrum to Frankfurt
 It would save lives, it would undercut the entire market for smugglers, and it would remove the chaos we see from Europe's front line in areas like the Greek islands
 It's politics that prevents us doing that rather than a rational solution
 Brazil has adopted a pioneering approach where over 2,000 Syrians have been able to get humanitarian visas, enter Brazil, and claim refugee status on arrival in Brazil
 Between 1922 and 1942, these Nansen passports were used as travel documents to allow 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens to travel across Europe and claim refugee status elsewhere in Europe
 And the Nansen International Refugee Office received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of this being a viable strategy
So all four of these ideas that I've presented you are ways in which we can expand Amira's choice set
 They're ways in which we can have greater choice for refugees beyond those basic, impossible three options I explained to you and still leave others better off
 There's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost
 Yes, they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they're human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, with the ability to make contributions -- if we let them
In the new world, migration is not going to go away
 What we've seen in Europe will be with us for many years
 People will continue to travel, they'll continue to be displaced, and we need to find rational, realistic ways of managing this -- not based on the old logics of humanitarian assistance, not based on logics of charity, but building on the opportunities offered by globalization, markets and mobility
 I'd urge you all to wake up and urge our politicians to wake up to this challenge
Thank you very much
 The doctor determines that you have high cholesterol and you would benefit from medication to treat it
 So you get a pillbox
 You have some confidence, your physician has some confidence that this is going to work
 The company that invented it did a lot of studies, submitted it to the FDA
 They studied it very carefully, skeptically, they approved it
 They have a rough idea of how it works, they have a rough idea of what the side effects are
 It should be OK
 Your physician says, "You know, I think you have some depression
 I'm going to have to give you another pill
"
So now we're talking about two medications
 This pill also -- millions of people have taken it, the company did studies, the FDA looked at it -- all good
 Think things should go OK
 Well, wait a minute
 How much have we studied these two together?
Well, it's very hard to do that
 In fact, it's not traditionally done
 How can we figure out if bad things are happening between two medications? Three? Five? Seven? Ask your favorite person who has several diagnoses how many medications they're on
Why do I care about this problem? I care about it deeply
 I'm an informatics and data science guy and really, in my opinion, the only hope -- only hope -- to understand these interactions is to leverage lots of different sources of data in order to figure out when drugs can be used together safely and when it's not so safe
 And it begins with my student Nick
 Let's call him "Nick," because that's his name
Nick was a young student
 I said, "You know, Nick, we have to understand how drugs work and how they work together and how they work separately, and we don't have a great understanding
 But the FDA has made available an amazing database
 It's a database of adverse events
 They literally put on the web -- publicly available, you could all download it right now -- hundreds of thousands of adverse event reports from patients, doctors, companies, pharmacists
 And these reports are pretty simple: it has all the diseases that the patient has, all the drugs that they're on, and all the adverse events, or side effects, that they experience
So I said to Nick, "Let's think about glucose
 Let's see if we can understand glucose response
 I sent Nick off
 Nick came back
"Russ," he said, "I've created a classifier that can look at the side effects of a drug based on looking at this database, and can tell you whether that drug is likely to change glucose or not
"
 It was very simple, in a way
 He took all the drugs that were known to change glucose and a bunch of drugs that don't change glucose, and said, "What's the difference in their side effects? Differences in fatigue? In appetite? In urination habits?" All those things conspired to give him a really good predictor
 He said, "Russ, I can predict with 93 percent accuracy when a drug will change glucose
"
I said, "Nick, that's great
" He's a young student, you have to build his confidence
 "But Nick, there's a problem
"
 I thought you might say that
" Nick is smart
 "I thought you might say that, so I did one other experiment
 I looked at people in this database who were on two drugs, and I looked for signals similar, glucose-changing signals, for people taking two drugs, where each drug alone did not change glucose, but together I saw a strong signal
"
And I said, "Oh! You're clever
 Good idea
 Show me the list
" And there's a bunch of drugs, not very exciting
 But what caught my eye was, on the list there were two drugs: paroxetine, or Paxil, an antidepressant; and pravastatin, or Pravachol, a cholesterol medication
And I said, "Huh
 There are millions of Americans on those two drugs
" In fact, we learned later, 15 million Americans on paroxetine at the time, 15 million on pravastatin, and a million, we estimated, on both
 So that's a million people who might be having some problems with their glucose if this machine-learning mumbo jumbo that he did in the FDA database actually holds up
 But I said, "It's still not publishable, because I love what you did with the mumbo jumbo, with the machine learning, but it's not really standard-of-proof evidence that we have
" So we have to do something else
 Let's go into the Stanford electronic medical record
 We have a copy of it that's OK for research, we removed identifying information
"
Now there are thousands and thousands of people in the Stanford medical records that take paroxetine and pravastatin
 But we needed special patients
 We needed patients who were on one of them and had a glucose measurement, then got the second one and had another glucose measurement, all within a reasonable period of time -- something like two months
 And when we did that, we found 10 patients
 However, eight out of the 10 had a bump in their glucose when they got the second P -- we call this P and P -- when they got the second P
 Either one could be first, the second one comes up, glucose went up 20 milligrams per deciliter
 Just as a reminder, you walk around normally, if you're not diabetic, with a glucose of around 90
 And if it gets up to 120, 125, your doctor begins to think about a potential diagnosis of diabetes
 So a 20 bump -- pretty significant
I said, "Nick, this is very cool
 But, I'm sorry, we still don't have a paper, because this is 10 patients and -- give me a break -- it's not enough patients
"
 Let's see if they can find similar patients with the one P, the other P, the glucose measurements in that range that we need
God bless them, Vanderbilt in one week found 40 such patients, same trend
 Harvard found 100 patients, same trend
 So at the end, we had 150 patients from three diverse medical centers that were telling us that patients getting these two drugs were having their glucose bump somewhat significantly
" We submitted the paper
 It was all data evidence, data from the FDA, data from Stanford, data from Vanderbilt, data from Harvard
But we were nervous
 So Nick, while the paper was in review, went to the lab
 I don't do that
 I take care of patients, but I don't do pipettes
 They taught us how to feed mice drugs
 We took mice and we gave them one P, paroxetine
 We gave some other mice pravastatin
 And we gave a third group of mice both of them
That was great, and the story could have ended there
 But I still have six and a half minutes
So we were sitting around thinking about all of this, and I don't remember who thought of it, but somebody said, "I wonder if patients who are taking these two drugs are noticing side effects of hyperglycemia
 How would we ever determine that?"
We said, well, what do you do? You're taking a medication, one new medication or two, and you get a funny feeling
 What do you do? You go to Google and type in the two drugs you're taking or the one drug you're taking, and you type in "side effects
" What are you experiencing? So we said OK, let's ask Google if they will share their search logs with us, so that we can look at the search logs and see if patients are doing these kinds of searches
 Google, I am sorry to say, denied our request
 So I was bummed
Yeah
 That's great
I felt like I was talking to Nick again
 He works for one of the largest companies in the world, and I'm already trying to make him feel better
 But he said, "No, Russ -- you might not understand
 We not only have Bing searches, but if you use Internet Explorer to do searches at Google, Yahoo, Bing, any 
 Then, for 18 months, we keep that data for research purposes only
So we did a study where we defined 50 words that a regular person might type in if they're having hyperglycemia, like "fatigue," "loss of appetite," "urinating a lot," "peeing a lot" -- forgive me, but that's one of the things you might type in
 So we had 50 phrases that we called the "diabetes words
 And it turns out that about 
 So that's our baseline rate
 If it's "pravastatin," the rate goes up to about three percent from the baseline
 If both "paroxetine" and "pravastatin" are present in the query, it goes up to 10 percent, a huge three- to four-fold increase in those searches with the two drugs that we were interested in, and diabetes-type words or hyperglycemia-type words
We published this, and it got some attention
 The reason it deserves attention is that patients are telling us their side effects indirectly through their searches
 We brought this to the attention of the FDA
 They have set up social media surveillance programs to collaborate with Microsoft, which had a nice infrastructure for doing this, and others, to look at Twitter feeds, to look at Facebook feeds, to look at search logs, to try to see early signs that drugs, either individually or together, are causing problems
 Nick went on; he's a professor at Columbia now
 He did this in his PhD for hundreds of pairs of drugs
 He found several very important interactions, and so we replicated this and we showed that this is a way that really works for finding drug-drug interactions
However, there's a couple of things
 As I said before, there are patients on three, five, seven, nine drugs
 Have they been studied with respect to their nine-way interaction? Yes, we can do pair-wise, A and B, A and C, A and D, but what about A, B, C, D, E, F, G all together, being taken by the same patient, perhaps interacting with each other in ways that either makes them more effective or less effective or causes side effects that are unexpected? We really have no idea
 I want you to think about the power that we were able to generate with the data from people who had volunteered their adverse reactions through their pharmacists, through themselves, through their doctors, the people who allowed the databases at Stanford, Harvard, Vanderbilt, to be used for research
 People are worried about data
 They're worried about their privacy and security -- they should be
 We need secure systems
 But we can't have a system that closes that data off, because it is too rich of a source of inspiration, innovation and discovery for new things in medicine
And the final thing I want to say is, in this case we found two drugs and it was a little bit of a sad story
 The two drugs actually caused problems
 They increased glucose
 They could throw somebody into diabetes who would otherwise not be in diabetes, and so you would want to use the two drugs very carefully together, perhaps not together, make different choices when you're prescribing
 But there was another possibility
 We could have found two drugs or three drugs that were interacting in a beneficial way
 We could have found new effects of drugs that neither of them has alone, but together, instead of causing a side effect, they could be a new and novel treatment for diseases that don't have treatments or where the treatments are not effective
And so the upside here, and the subject for a different TED Talk on a different day, is how can we use the same data sources to find good effects of drugs in combination that will provide us new treatments, new insights into how drugs work and enable us to take care of our patients even better?
Thank you very much
I'm a textile artist most widely known for starting the yarn bombing movement
 Yarn bombing is when you take knitted or crocheted material out into the urban environment, graffiti-style -- or, more specifically, without permission and unsanctioned
 All I wanted to see was something warm and fuzzy and human-like on the cold, steel, gray facade that I looked at everyday
So I wrapped the door handle
 Little did I know that this tiny piece would change the course of my life
So clearly the reaction was interesting
 It intrigued me and I thought, "What else could I do?" Could I do something in the public domain that would get the same reaction? So I wrapped the stop sign pole near my house
 The reaction was wild
 People would park their cars and get out of their cars and stare at it, and scratch their heads and stare at it, and take pictures of it and take pictures next to it, and all of that was really exciting to me and I wanted to do every stop sign pole in the neighborhood
 And the more that I did, the stronger the reaction
So at this point I'm smitten
 I'm hooked
 This was all seductive
 I found my new passion and the urban environment was my playground
So this is some of my early work
 I was very curious about this idea of enhancing the ordinary, the mundane, even the ugly, and not taking away its identity or its functionality but just giving it a well-tailored suit out of knitting
 And this was fun for me
 It was really fun to take inanimate objects and have them come to life
So 
 I think we all see the humor in this, but --
I was at a point where I wanted to take it seriously
 I wanted to know why I was letting this take over my life, why I was passionate about it, why were other people reacting so strongly to it
 We all live in this fast-paced, digital world, but we still crave and desire something that's relatable
 So when you stumble upon a stop sign pole that's wrapped in knitting and it seems so out of place and then gradually -- weirdly -- you find a connection to it, that is the moment
 That is the moment I love and that is the moment I love to share with others
 It went from the fire hydrants and the stop sign poles to what else can I do with this material
 Can I do something big and large-scale and insurmountable?
So that's when the bus happened
 This was a real game changer for me
 I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one
At this point, people were recognizing my work but there wasn't much out there that was wrapped in knitting that was large-scale, and this definitely was the first city bus to be wrapped in knitting
So at this point, I'm experiencing, or I'm witnessing something interesting
 I may have started yarn bombing but I certainly don't own it anymore
 It had reached global status
 People from all over the world were doing this
 And I know this because I would travel to certain parts of the world that I'd never been to, and I'd stumble upon a stop sign pole and I knew I didn't wrap it
So as I pursued my own goals with my art -- this is a lot of my recent work -- so was yarn bombing
 Yarn bombing was also growing
 It was through this granny hobby -- this unassuming hobby -- that I found commonality with people that I never thought I'd have a connection with
So as I tell my story today, I'd also like to convey to you that hidden power can be found in the most unassuming places, and we all possess skills that are just waiting to be discovered
 And I'm totally guilty of this as well
 But if you think about it, what would happen if you put those things down? What would you make? What would you create with your own hands?
A lot of people think that I am a master knitter but I actually couldn't knit a sweater to save my life
 But I did something interesting with knitting that had never been done before
I also wasn't "supposed to be" an artist in the sense that I wasn't formally trained to do this -- I'm a math major actually
 So I didn't think this was in the cards for me, but I also know that I didn't stumble upon this
 And when this happened to me, I held on tight, I fought for it and I'm proud to say that I am a working artist today
 And one day, you might be as bored as I was and knit a door handle to change your world forever
Thank you
As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean
 It was this wild place full of color and life, home to these alien-looking, fantastical creatures
 I pictured big sharks ruling the food chain and saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs
As a marine biologist turned photographer, I've spent most of my career looking for places as magical as those I used to dream about when I was little
 As you can see, I began exploring bodies of water at a fairly young age
 But the first time I truly went underwater, I was about 10 years old
 And I can still vividly remember furiously finning to reach this old, encrusted cannon on a shallow coral reef
 That was the day I fell in love with the ocean
Thomas Peschak
Conservation Photographer
 I've photographed everything from really, really big sharks to dainty ones that fit in the palm of your hand
 I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath of humpback whales feeding just feet away from me in the cold seas off Canada's Great Bear Rainforest
 And I've been privy to the mating rituals of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel
Everyone on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean
 And the pristine seas I used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find
 As we humans continue to maintain our role as the leading predator on earth, I've witnessed and photographed many of these ripple effects firsthand
 For a long time, I thought I had to shock my audience out of their indifference with disturbing images
 And while this approach has merits, I have come full circle
 I believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love
 I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts and as a photographer, I have the rare opportunity to reveal animals and entire ecosystems that lie hidden beneath the ocean's surface
 You can't love something and become a champion for it if you don't know it exists
 Uncovering this -- that is the power of conservation photography
I've visited hundreds of marine locations, but there are a handful of seascapes that have touched me incredibly deeply
 And every June and July, enormous shoals of sardines travel northwards in a mass migration we call the Sardine Run
 And boy, do those fish have good reason to run
 In hot pursuit are hoards of hungry and agile predators
 Common dolphins hunt together and they can separate some of the sardines from the main shoal and they create bait balls
 They drive and trap the fish upward against the ocean surface and then they rush in to dine on this pulsating and movable feast
 Close behind are sharks
 Now, most people believe that sharks and dolphins are these mortal enemies, but during the Sardine Run, they actually coexist
 In fact, dolphins actually help sharks feed more effectively
 Without dolphins, the bait balls are more dispersed and sharks often end up with what I call a sardine donut, or a mouth full of water
 However, I get bumped and tail-slapped just like any other guest at this rowdy, rowdy banquet
 And during the stormy southwest monsoon, manta rays from all across the archipelago travel to a tiny speck in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru
 Armies of crustaceans, most no bigger than the size of your pupils, are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet
 When plankton concentrations become patchy, manta rays feed alone and they somersault themselves backwards again and again, very much like a puppy chasing its own tail
 As plankton levels peak in the bay, the mantas swim closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cyclone feeding
 And as they swirl in tight formation, this multi-step column of mantas creates its own vortex, sucking in and delivering the plankton right into the mantas' cavernous mouths
When I first photographed Hanifaru, the site enjoyed no protection and was threatened by development
 And working with NGOs like the Manta Trust, my images eventually helped Hanifaru become a marine-protected area
 Now, fisherman from neighboring islands, they once hunted these manta rays to make traditional drums from their skins
 Today, they are the most ardent conservation champions and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy in excess of 8 million dollars every single year
I have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly blank or they read, "There be dragons
" And today, the closest I've come is visiting remote atolls in the western Indian Ocean
 Far, far away from shipping lanes and fishing fleets, diving into these waters is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like
Very few people have heard of Bassas da India, a tiny speck of coral in the Mozambique Channel
 Its reef forms a protective outer barrier and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground for Galapagos sharks
 These sharks are anything but shy, even during the day
 I had a bit of a hunch that they'd be even bolder and more abundant at night
Never before have I encountered so many sharks on a single coral outcrop
 Capturing and sharing moments like this -- that reminds me why I chose my path
Earlier this year, I was on assignment for National Geographic Magazine in Baja California
 And about halfway down the peninsula on the Pacific side lies San Ignacio Lagoon, a critical calving ground for gray whales
 For 100 years, this coast was the scene of a wholesale slaughter, where more than 20,000 gray whales were killed, leaving only a few hundred survivors
 Today the descendents of these same whales nudge their youngsters to the surface to play and even interact with us
This species truly has made a remarkable comeback
Now, on the other side of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo, a sleepy fishing village
 Decades of overfishing had brought them close to collapse
 In 1995, local fisherman convinced the authorities to proclaim their waters a marine reserve
 But what happened next was nothing short of miraculous
 In 2005, after only a single decade of protection, scientists measured the largest recovery of fish ever recorded
But don't take my word for it -- come with me
 On a single breath, swim with me in deep, into one of the largest and densest schools of fish I have ever encountered
We all have the ability to be creators of hope
 And particularly, I want to focus on nature's resilience in the face of 7
3 billion people
My hope is that in the future, I will have to search much, much harder to make photographs like this, while creating images that showcase our respectful coexistence with the ocean
 Those will hopefully become an everyday occurrence for me
To thrive and survive in my profession, you really have to be a hopeless optimist
 And I always operate on the assumption that the next great picture that will effect change is right around the corner, behind the next coral head, inside the next lagoon or possibly, in the one after it
 We all need air to breathe
 We need clean water to drink
 We need food to eat
 You know
 Love is great, too
 Yeah?
As a trans person who doesn't fit neatly into the gender binary, if I could change the world tomorrow to make it easier for me to navigate, the very first thing I would do is blink and create single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms in all public places
 And this is a great and necessary thing, but most of that attention has been focused on a very few individuals, most of whom are kinda rich and pretty famous, and probably don't have to worry that much anymore about where they're going to pee in between classes at their community college, or where they're going to get changed into their gym strip at their public high school
 Fame and money insulates these television star trans people from most of the everyday challenges that the rest of us have to tackle on a daily basis
 They've been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember, first when I was just a little baby tomboy and then later as a masculine-appearing, predominantly estrogen-based organism
Now, today as a trans person, public bathrooms and change rooms are where I am most likely to be questioned or harassed
 I've often been verbally attacked behind their doors
 I've been hauled out by security guards with my pants still halfway pulled up
And I know what some of you are thinking, and you're mostly right
 I can and do just use the men's room most of the time these days
 But that doesn't solve my change room dilemmas, does it? And I shouldn't have to use the men's room because I'm not a man
And now we've got these fearmongering politicians that keep trying to pass these bathroom bills
 And if these politicians ever get their way, in Arizona or California or Florida or just last week in Houston, Texas, or Ottawa, well then, using the men's room will not be a legal option for me either
And every time one of these politicians brings one of these bills to the table, I can't help but wonder, you know, just who will and exactly how would we go about enforcing laws like these
 Right? Panty checks? Really
 Genital inspections outside of bath change rooms at public pools? There's no legal or ethical or plausible way to enforce laws like these anyway
 They exist only to foster fear and promote transphobia
 They don't make anyone safer
 But they do for sure make the world more dangerous for some of us
And meanwhile, our trans children suffer
 They drop out of school, or they opt out of life altogether
 Trans people, especially trans and gender-nonconforming youth face additional challenges when accessing pools and gyms, but also universities, hospitals, libraries
 Don't even get me started on how they treat us in airports
 We need to just admit that they are really only open for people who fit neatly into one of two gender boxes, which I do not
 I never have
 And this starts very early
I know a little girl
 She's the daughter of a friend of mine
 She's a self-identified tomboy
 I'm talking about cowboy boots and Caterpillar yellow toy trucks and bug jars, the whole nine yards
 One time I asked her what her favorite color was
 She told me, "Camouflage
"
So that awesome little kid, she came home from school last October from her half day of preschool with soggy pants on because the other kids at school were harassing her when she tried to use the girls' bathroom
 And the teacher had already instructed her to stay out of the boys' bathroom
 And she had drank two glasses of that red juice at the Halloween party, and I mean, who can resist that red juice, right? It's so good
Her and her classmates were four years old
 They already felt empowered enough to police her use of the so-called public bathrooms
 She was four years old
 She'd already learned that bathrooms were going to be a problem, and that problem started with her and was hers alone
 I wanted to tell her that me and her mom were going to march on down and talk to that school, and the problem was going to go away, but I knew that wasn't true
 I wanted to tell her that it was all going to get better when she got older, but I couldn't
 So I asked her to tell me the story of what had happened, asked her to tell me how it made her feel
 "Mad and sad," she told me
 So I told her that she wasn't alone and that it wasn't right what had happened to her, and then she asked me if I had ever peed in my pants before
Which of course was a lie, because you know how you hit, like, 42 or 43, and sometimes you just, I don't know, you pee a little bit when you cough or sneeze, when you're running upstairs, or you're stretching
 Don't lie
I told her, when you get older, your bladder is going to grow bigger, too
"Until you can get home?" she asked me
I said, "Yes, until you can get home
" She seemed to take some comfort in that
So let's just build some single stall, gender-neutral bathrooms with a little bench for getting changed into your gym clothes
 We can't change the world overnight for our children, but we can give them a safe and private place to escape that world, if only for just a minute
 This we can do
 So let's just do it
 If you can't bring yourself to care enough about people like me, then what about women and girls with body image issues? What about anyone with body image stuff going on? What about that boy at school who is a foot shorter than his classmates, whose voice still hasn't dropped yet? Hey? Oh, grade eight, what a cruel master you can be
 Right? What about people with anxiety issues? What about people with disabilities or who need assistance in there? What about folks with bodies who, for whatever reason, don't fit into the mainstream idea of what a body should look like? How many of us still feel shy or afraid to disrobe in front of our peers, and how many of us allow that fear to keep us from something as important as physical exercise? Would all those people not benefit from these single stall facilities?
We can't change transphobic minds overnight, but we can give everybody a place to get changed in so that we can all get to work making the world safer for all of us
Thank you
 The new government emerged from a long war of independence and immediately proclaimed a socialist agenda: health care services, primary education became essentially free
 A massive expansion of rural health centers placed roughly 80 percent of the population less than a two-hour walk from these facilities, a truly remarkable accomplishment
 In 1980, the year of independence, 25 percent of Zimbabwean children were fully immunized
 By 1990, a mere decade later, this proportion stood at 80 percent
I felt tremendously privileged to be part of this transformation, a revolution
 The excitement, the camaraderie, was palpable
 Working side by side with brilliant Zimbabweans -- scientists, doctors, activists -- I felt connected not only to an African independence movement, but to a global progressive public health movement
 Zimbabwe reported its first AIDS case in 1985, the year I arrived
 Infection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there
 These would soar to one out of every four adults by the time I left Harare 17 years later
 By the mid-1990s, I'd told hundreds of people in the prime of life that they were HIV-positive
 We did condom demonstrations
 We launched school education and workplace interventions
 We did research
 We counseled the partners of infected men about how to protect themselves
 We worked hard, and at the time, I believed that I was doing my best
 I was providing excellent treatment, such as it was
Former UN Secretary Kofi Annan has spoken candidly about his personal failure leading to the Rwandan genocide
 In 1994, he was head of the UN peacekeeping department
 At a 10-year memorial for the genocide, he reflected, "I believed at the time I was doing my best, but I realized after the genocide that there was more I could and should have done to sound the alarm and rally support
"
The AIDS epidemic caught the health community unprepared, and today, when the World Health Organization estimates that 39 million people have lost their lives to this disease, I'm not alone in feeling remorse and regret at not having done more earlier
But while living in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as an advocacy or a political one
 I was there for my technical skills, both my clinical and my research epidemiology skills
 And in my mind, my job was to take care of patients and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission, and I hoped that we'd slow the spread of the virus
 I was aware that socially marginalized populations were at disproportionate risk of getting and dying of AIDS
I worked to show how getting infected was not a moral failure but instead related to a culture of male superiority, to forced migrant labor and to colonialism
 Whites were largely unscathed
As health professionals, our tools were pitifully weak: imploring people to change their individual behaviors, use condoms, reduce number of partners
 I didn't speak out about the unequal access to these life-saving drugs or about the underlying economic and political systems that were driving infection rates in such huge swaths of the population
 I rationalized my silence by reminding myself that I was a guest in the country, that sounding the alarm could even get me kicked out, keep me from doing good work, taking care of my patients, doing much-needed research
 I didn't voice my concerns loudly enough
Many doctors, health professionals, may think I did nothing wrong
 Our pact with our patients, the Hippocratic Oath and its variants, is about the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship
 And I did everything I could for each and every patient of mine
But I knew that epidemics emerge along the fissures of our society, reflecting not only biology, but more importantly patterns of marginalization, exclusion, discrimination related to race, gender, sexuality, class and more
 It was true of AIDS
 It was true just recently of Ebola
 We do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social injustices
 Sounding the alarm is the first step towards doing public health right, and it's how we may rally support to break through and create real change together
So these days, I'm not staying quiet
 And a lot of this is about racial disparities and institutionalized racism, things that we're not supposed to have in this country anymore, certainly not in the practice of medicine or public health
 But we have them, and we pay for them in lives cut short
 That's why sounding the alarm about the impact of racism on health in the United States, the ongoing institutional and interpersonal violence that people of color face, compounded by our tragic legacy of 250 years of slavery, 90 years of Jim Crow and 60 years of imperfect equality, sounding the alarm about this is central to doing my job right as New York City's Health Commissioner
 A black woman in 2012 faced more than 10 times the risk of dying related to childbirth as a white woman
 And though we've made enormous strides in reducing infant mortality rates, a black baby still faces nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life as compared to a white baby
New York City's not exceptional
 A recent New York Times analysis reported that there are 1
5 million missing black men across the country
 They noted that more than one out of every six black men who today should be between the ages of 25 and 54 years have disappeared from daily life, lost either to prison or premature death
 There is great injustice in the daily and disproportionate violence faced by young black men, the focus of recent protests under the banner #BlackLivesMatter
 But we have to remember that enduring and disparate rates and the occurrence and outcome of common medical conditions -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV -- diseases that may kill slowly and quietly and take even more black lives prematurely
 Our medical students held die-ins in their white coats, but the medical community has largely stood by passively as ongoing discrimination continues to affect the disease profile and mortality
 And I worry that the trend towards personalized and precision medicine, looking for biological or genetic targets to better tailor treatment, may inadvertently cause us to lose sight of the big picture, that it is the daily context, where a person lives, grows, works, loves, that most importantly determines population health, and for too many of us, poor health
Our role as health professionals is not just to treat our patients but to sound the alarm and advocate for change
 Rightfully or not, our societal position gives our voices great credibility, and we shouldn't waste that
I regret not speaking up in Zimbabwe, and I've promised myself that as New York City's Health Commissioner, I will use every opportunity I have to sound the alarm and rally support for health equity
 I will speak out against racism, and I hope you will join me, and I will join you when you speak out against sexism or any other form of inequality
 It's time for us to rise up and collectively speak up about structural inequality
 We don't have to have all the answers to call for change
 We just need courage
 The health of our patients, the health of us all, depends on it
Now, these beliefs did not come naturally to me, because trusting big institutions, not really part of my family legacy
 Later, when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the United States, she had to defy an entire culture that said the girls would never be the best and brightest
 Only because her name happens to sound like a boy's was she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam to come to the United States
Because of her bravery and passion, I've had all the opportunities that she never did, and that has made my story so different
 I've had the chance over the course of my career to work for The Wall Street Journal, the White House and now one of the largest financial institutions in the world, where I lead sustainable investing
Now, these institutions are like tankers, and working inside of them, I've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave, and I've become convinced that the institution of the global capital markets, the nearly 290 trillion dollars of stocks and bonds in the world, that that may be one of our most powerful forces for positive social change at our disposal, if we ask it to be
Now, I know some of you are thinking, global capital markets, positive social change, not usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph
 I think many people think of the capital markets kind of like an ocean
 So the best that our little savings accounts or retirement accounts can do is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles and hope that we don't get inundated in the turbulent ones, but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts don't affect the tides, don't change the shape or size or direction of the waves
But why is that? Because actually, one third of this ocean of capital actually belongs to individuals like us, and most of the rest of the capital markets is controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority and their capital from us, as members, participants, beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens
 So if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets, why aren't we able to make our voices heard? Why can't we make some waves?
So let me ask you a different question: did any of you buy fair trade coffee the last time you were at a supermarket or at Starbucks? OK
So why do we do these things? Right? One electric car doesn't amount to much in a fleet of 1
2 billion combustion engine vehicles
 One fish is just one fish in the sea
 And one cup of coffee doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world
 But we do these things because we believe they matter, that our actions add up, that our choices might influence others and collectively, what an impact we can have
So, in my bag I have a coffee mug that I bought a couple of years ago
 It's a reusable mug
 It has all these things printed on it
 Look at some of the things that are on it, that it says
"This one cup can be used again and again
"
"This one cup may inspire others to use one too
"
" I had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful
So why do we think that our choice of a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee in a reusable mug matters, but what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account for our IRA doesn't? Why can't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets that we care, that we care about fair labor standards, that we care about sustainable production methods and about healthy communities? Why aren't we voting with our investment dollars, but we would vote with our lattes?
So I think it has something to do with the myths, the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness
 Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot? If you said to the pot, "Boil, little pot, boil," it would fill up with sweet porridge
 And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop," it would stop
 But if you got the words wrong, it wouldn't listen, and things could go terribly awry
 So I think when it comes to markets, we have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads
 We believe that the markets is this magic pot that obeys only one command: make more money
 Only those words said exactly that way will make the pot fill up with gold
 Add in some extra words like "protect the environment," the spell might not work
So we asked people, what do you really think? And we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors, and we found something fascinating
 Overwhelmingly, people wanted to add those extra words into the formula
 71 percent of people said yes, they were interested in sustainable investing, which we define as taking the best in class investment process that you already have traditionally and adding in the extra information you get when you think about the environment and society and good governance
 71 percent wanted that
 72 percent said that they believe that companies who did that would actually do better financially
 So people really do believe that you can do well by doing good
So is it true? Do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade-grown coffee instead of drinking it? Well, you know, the investors in companies like Burt's Bees or Ben & Jerry's wouldn't say so
 Right? Both of those started out as small, socially conscious companies that ended up becoming so popular with consumers that the giants Unilever and Clorox bought them for hundreds of millions of dollars each
 But here's the important thing
 Those corporations realized that if they wanted to protect the value of their investments, they had to preserve that socially conscious mission
 If they didn't keep adding in those extra words of environmentally friendly and socially conscious, those brands wouldn't make more money
 If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago in a portfolio of companies that focused narrowly on making more money quarter by quarter, that one dollar would have grown to 14 dollars and 46 cents
 That's not bad until you consider that if instead you'd invested that same dollar in a portfolio of companies that focused on growing their business and on the most important environmental and social issues, that one dollar would have grown to 28 dollars and 36 cents
 almost twice as much sweet porridge
Now, let's be clear, they didn't make that outperformance by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen
 They did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business, like wasting less energy and water in their manufacturing processes; like making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized for the long-term results of the company and the communities they served, not just quarterly results; or building a first class culture that would have higher employee loyalty, retention and productivity
 Now, Harvard's not alone
 Oxford also did a research study where they examined 120 different studies looking at the effect of sustainability and economic results, and they found time and time and time again that the companies that cared about these kinds of important things actually had better operational efficiency, lower cost of capital and better performance in their stock price
And then there's Al Gore
 So 20 years ago, when I worked for Al Gore in the White House, he was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments to pay attention to the challenges of climate change
 Ten years later, his track record is one more proof point that sustainable investing done right can be sound investing
 Far from making less sweet porridge because he added sustainability into the mix, he actually significantly outperformed the benchmark
 It is not just about private equity for billionaires
 It's not just groovy-sounding investments like clean technology or microfinance in emerging markets or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn
 It's about mutual funds
So here's why I'm convinced that we collectively have the power to make sustainable investing the new normal
First, the proof points are coming out all the time that sustainable investing done right, preserving all the same good principles of investing, the traditional sphere, can pay
 It makes sense
Secondly, the biggest obstacle standing in our way may actually just be in our heads
 We just need to let go of that myth that if you add your values into your investment thinking, that you get less sweet porridge
 And once you get rid of the fable, you can actually start appreciating those facts we've been talking about
And third, the future is already here
 Sustainable investment today is a 20 trillion dollar market and it's the fastest-growing segment of the investment industry
 In the United States, it has grown enormously, as you can see
So what are we waiting for? For me, it goes back to the inspiration that I received from my mother
 She knew that she wanted a life where she would have the freedom to make her own choices and to have her voice heard and write her own story
 She was passionate about that goal and she was clear that she would let no army, no obstacle, no big institution stand in her way
 She made it to the States, and she became a teacher, an award-winning author and a mother, and ended up sending her daughters to Harvard
 And these days, you can tell that she is amply comfortable holding court in the most powerful institutions in the world
 It seems almost too prophetic that her name in Korean means "passionate clarity
"
 that's what I think we need to drive change
 Passion about the change we want to see in the world, and clarity that we are able to help chart the course
 We have more opportunity today than ever before to make choices
 We have more power than ever before to make our voices heard
So change your perspective
 Vote with your small change
 Invest in the change you want to see in the world
 Change the fables and change the markets
Thank you
What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister
 Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist
 Or just an airport security line delay
If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you
 That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me
 One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative
 And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim
 I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers
Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you
 Let me tell you who I am
 I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, cream on the side
 I'm an introvert
 I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic
 And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim
 But not like Lady Gaga says, because baby, I wasn't born this way
 It was a choice
 No, not as a gay person like some of my friends, but as a Muslim, and decided to start wearing the hijab, my head covering
 My feminist friends were aghast: "Why are you oppressing yourself?" The funny thing was, it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty
 I didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents
 I wrestled with the Quran
 My relationship with God -- it was not love at first sight
 It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every reading of the Quran
 Its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears
 I see myself in it
 I feel that God knows me
 Have you ever felt like someone sees you, completely understands you and yet loves you anyway? That's how it feels
And so later, I got married, and like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer
I later had a child, after getting married, and I was living essentially the Egyptian-American dream
And then that terrible morning of September, 2001
 I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning
 I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast, and I look up on the screen and see the words "Breaking News
" There was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings, people jumping out of buildings
 What was this? An accident? A malfunction? My shock quickly turned to outrage
 Who would do this? And I switch the channel and I hear,
"
 Muslim terrorist 
," "
 in the name of Islam 
," "
 Middle-Eastern descent 
," "
," "
 we should bomb Mecca
" Oh my God
Not only had my country been attacked, but in a flash, somebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen to a suspect
That same day, we had to drive across Middle America to move to a new city to start grad school
 And I remember sitting in the passenger seat as we drove in silence, crouched as low as I could go in my seat, for the first time in my life, afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim
We moved into our apartment that night in a new town in what felt like a completely different world
 And then I was hearing and seeing and reading warnings from national Muslim organizations saying things like, "Be alert," "Be aware," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't congregate
"
I stayed inside all week
 And then it was Friday that same week, the day that Muslims congregate for worship
 And again the warnings were, "Don't go that first Friday, it could be a target
 Emotions were so raw, understandably, and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims, or people who were perceived to be Muslim, being pulled out and beaten in the street
 Mosques were actually firebombed
 And I thought, we should just stay home
And yet, something didn't feel right
 Because those people who attacked our country attacked our country
 Guess what? So was I
 And so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy
 I don't mind questions
 I love questions
 It's the accusations that are tough
Today we hear people actually saying things like, "There's a problem in this country, and it's called Muslims
 They talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America
 And the only question is, are we malignant or benign? You know, a malignant tumor you extract altogether, and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance
The choices don't make sense, because it's the wrong question
 Muslims, like all other Americans, aren't a tumor in the body of America, we're a vital organ
Thank you
Now, is closing down mosques going to make America safer? It might free up some parking spots, but it will not end terrorism
 Going to a mosque regularly is actually linked to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement
 They get radicalized in their basement or bedroom, in front of a computer
 And what you find about the radicalization process is it starts online, but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off from their community, from even their family, so that the extremist group can brainwash them into believing that they, the terrorists, are the true Muslims, and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates
 So if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to keep people going to the mosque
Now, some will still argue Islam is a violent religion
 After all, a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran
 But we would be giving in to their narrative if we cast them as representatives of a faith of 1
6 billion people
Thank you
ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity
Both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book
 But when you look at them, they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book
 It's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture
Recently, a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback
 And I was really surprised and asked him, had she been in contact with a radical religious leader? And he said the problem was quite the opposite, that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down and said that her rage, her sense of injustice in the world, was just going to get her in trouble
 And so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger, she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution
 He didn't shame her for her rage -- instead, he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world
 What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS
I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia affects me and my family
 But how does it impact ordinary Americans? How does it impact everyone else? How does consuming fear 24 hours a day affect the health of our democracy, the health of our free thought?
Well, one study -- actually, several studies in neuroscience -- show that when we're afraid, at least three things happen
 We become more accepting of authoritarianism, conformity and prejudice
 One study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims, they became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims
Now, this isn't just academic
 When you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorist attacks
 So Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected
 It can actually be a tool of public manipulation, eroding the very foundation of a free society, which is rational and well-informed citizens
 Muslims are like canaries in the coal mine
 We might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear is harming us all
And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having to explain yourself all the time
 Deah was an athlete
 He was in dental school, talented, promising 
 And his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous human being she knew
 She said, "When did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man?" Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his new wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting for the afternoon, in their apartment, execution style, after posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page
 So bigotry isn't just immoral, it can even be lethal
So, back to my story
 What happened after 9/11? Did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home? Well, we talked it over, and it might seem like a small decision, but to us, it was about what kind of America we wanted to leave for our kids: one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing our religion freely
 So we decided to go to the mosque
 And we put my son in his car seat, buckled him in, and we drove silently, intensely, to the mosque
 I took him out, I took off my shoes, I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop
 The place was completely full
 And then the imam made an announcement, thanking and welcoming our guests, because half the congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, people of faith and no faith, who had come not to attack us, but to stand in solidarity with us
I just break down at this time
 These people were there because they chose courage and compassion over panic and prejudice
What will you choose? What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry? Will you play it safe? Or will you join those who say we are better than that?
Thank you so much
 So Dalia, you seem to have struck a chord
 But I wonder, what would you say to those who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk, you're clearly a deep thinker, you work at a fancy think tank, you're an exception, you're not the rule
 What would you say to those people?
 I would say, don't let this stage distract you, I'm completely ordinary
 I'm not an exception
 My story is not unusual
 I am as ordinary as they come
 When you look at Muslims around the world -- and I've done this, I've done the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want ordinary things
 They want prosperity for their family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace
 So I am not in any way an exception
 When you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule, oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, not that they're an exception to it
I was excited to be a part of the "Dream" theme, and then I found out I'm leading off the "Nightmare?" section of it
And certainly there are things about the climate crisis that qualify
 And I have some bad news, but I have a lot more good news
 I'm going to propose three questions and the answer to the first one necessarily involves a little bad news
 But -- hang on, because the answers to the second and third questions really are very positive
So the first question is, "Do we really have to change?" And of course, the Apollo Mission, among other things changed the environmental movement, really launched the modern environmental movement
 18 months after this Earthrise picture was first seen on earth, the first Earth Day was organized
 And we learned a lot about ourselves looking back at our planet from space
 And one of the things that we learned confirmed what the scientists have long told us
 One of the most essential facts about the climate crisis has to do with the sky
 As this picture illustrates, the sky is not the vast and limitless expanse that appears when we look up from the ground
 It is a very thin shell of atmosphere surrounding the planet
 That right now is the open sewer for our industrial civilization as it's currently organized
 We are spewing 110 million tons of heat-trapping global warming pollution into it every 24 hours, free of charge, go ahead
And there are many sources of the greenhouse gases, I'm certainly not going to go through them all
 I'm going to focus on the main one, but agriculture is involved, diet is involved, population is involved
 Management of forests, transportation, the oceans, the melting of the permafrost
 But I'm going to focus on the heart of the problem, which is the fact that we still rely on dirty, carbon-based fuels for 85 percent of all the energy that our world burns every year
 And you can see from this image that after World War II, the emission rates started really accelerating
 Fact-checked over and over again, conservative, it's the truth
 Now it's a big planet, but --
that is a lot of energy, particularly when you multiply it 400,000 times per day
 And all that extra heat energy is heating up the atmosphere, the whole earth system
Let's look at the atmosphere
 This is a depiction of what we used to think of as the normal distribution of temperatures
 The white represents normal temperature days; 1951-1980 are arbitrarily chosen
 The blue are cooler than average days, the red are warmer than average days
 But the entire curve has moved to the right in the 1980s
 And you'll see in the lower right-hand corner the appearance of statistically significant numbers of extremely hot days
 In the 90s, the curve shifted further
 And in the last 10 years, you see the extremely hot days are now more numerous than the cooler than average days
 In fact, they are 150 times more common on the surface of the earth than they were just 30 years ago
So we're having record-breaking temperatures
 Last month was the 371st month in a row warmer than the 20th-century average
 And for the first time, not only the warmest January, but for the first time, it was more than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the average
 These higher temperatures are having an effect on animals, plants, people, ecosystems
 And the scientists can measure the heat buildup much more precisely now at all depths: deep, mid-ocean, the first few hundred meters
 And this, too, is accelerating
 It goes back more than a century
 This has consequences
The first order of consequence: the ocean-based storms get stronger
 Super Typhoon Haiyan went over areas of the Pacific five and a half degrees Fahrenheit warmer than normal before it slammed into Tacloban, as the most destructive storm ever to make landfall
 Pope Francis, who has made such a difference to this whole issue, visited Tacloban right after that
 Superstorm Sandy went over areas of the Atlantic nine degrees warmer than normal before slamming into New York and New Jersey
 The second order of consequences are affecting all of us right now
 The warmer oceans are evaporating much more water vapor into the skies
 Average humidity worldwide has gone up four percent
 And it creates these atmospheric rivers
 The Brazilian scientists call them "flying rivers
" And they funnel all of that extra water vapor over the land where storm conditions trigger these massive record-breaking downpours
 This is from Montana
 As it moves over Tucson, Arizona
 It literally splashes off the city
 These downpours are really unusual
Last July in Houston, Texas, it rained for two days, 162 billion gallons
 That represents more than two days of the full flow of Niagara Falls in the middle of the city, which was, of course, paralyzed
 These record downpours are creating historic floods and mudslides
This one is from Chile last year
 And you'll see that warehouse going by
 There are oil tankers cars going by
 This is from Spain last September, you could call this the running of the cars and trucks, I guess
 Every night on the TV news now is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation
I mean, really
 They're not under any illusions about what's happening
 We're used to thinking of linear cause and linear effect -- one cause, one effect
 This is systemic causation
 As the great Kevin Trenberth says, "All storms are different now
 There's so much extra energy in the atmosphere, there's so much extra water vapor
" So, the same extra heat pulls the soil moisture out of the ground and causes these deeper, longer, more pervasive droughts and many of them are underway right now
It dries out the vegetation and causes more fires in the western part of North America
 There's certainly been evidence of that, a lot of them
More lightning, as the heat energy builds up, there's a considerable amount of additional lightning also
These climate-related disasters also have geopolitical consequences and create instability
 The climate-related historic drought that started in Syria in 2006 destroyed 60 percent of the farms in Syria, killed 80 percent of the livestock, and drove 1
5 million climate refugees into the cities of Syria, where they collided with another 1
5 million refugees from the Iraq War
 And along with other factors, that opened the gates of Hell that people are trying to close now
 The US Defense Department has long warned of consequences from the climate crisis, including refugees, food and water shortages and pandemic disease
Right now we're seeing microbial diseases from the tropics spread to the higher latitudes; the transportation revolution has had a lot to do with this
 But the changing conditions change the latitudes and the areas where these microbial diseases can become endemic and change the range of the vectors, like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them
 The Zika epidemic now -- we're better positioned in North America because it's still a little too cool and we have a better public health system
 But when women in some regions of South and Central America are advised not to get pregnant for two years -- that's something new, that ought to get our attention
 The Lancet, one of the two greatest medical journals in the world, last summer labeled this a medical emergency now
 And there are many factors because of it
This is also connected to the extinction crisis
 And already, land-based plants and animals are now moving towards the poles at an average rate of 15 feet per day
Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph from Svalbard illustrates this
 It's more dangerous coming off Greenland and particularly, Antarctica
 The 10 largest risk cities for sea-level rise by population are mostly in South and Southeast Asia
 When you measure it by assets at risk, number one is Miami: three and a half trillion dollars at risk
 Number three: New York and Newark
 I was in Miami last fall during the supermoon, one of the highest high-tide days
 And there were fish from the ocean swimming in some of the streets of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale and Del Rey
 And this happens regularly during the highest-tide tides now
 Not with rain -- they call it "sunny-day flooding
" It comes up through the storm sewers
 And the Mayor of Miami speaks for many when he says it is long past time this can be viewed through a partisan lens
 This is a crisis that's getting worse day by day
 We have to move beyond partisanship
And I want to take a moment to honor these House Republicans --
who had the courage last fall to step out and take a political risk, by telling the truth about the climate crisis
 It's an enormous burden
 I'll mention just one more, because the World Economic Forum last month in Davos, after their annual survey of 750 economists, said the climate crisis is now the number one risk to the global economy
 So you get central bankers like Mark Carney, the head of the UK Central Bank, saying the vast majority of the carbon reserves are unburnable
 Subprime carbon
 If you look at all of the carbon fuels that were burned since the beginning of the industrial revolution, this is the quantity burned in the last 16 years
 Here are all the ones that are proven and left on the books, 28 trillion dollars
 The International Energy Agency says only this amount can be burned
 So the rest, 22 trillion dollars -- unburnable
 Risk to the global economy
 That's why divestment movement makes practical sense and is not just a moral imperative
So the answer to the first question, "Must we change?" is yes, we have to change
 Second question, "Can we change?" This is the exciting news! The best projections in the world 16 years ago were that by 2010, the world would be able to install 30 gigawatts of wind capacity
 We beat that mark by 14 and a half times over
 We see an exponential curve for wind installations now
 We see the cost coming down dramatically
 Some countries -- take Germany, an industrial powerhouse with a climate not that different from Vancouver's, by the way -- one day last December, got 81 percent of all its energy from renewable resources, mainly solar and wind
 energy storage, from batteries particularly, is now beginning to take off because the cost has been coming down very dramatically to solve the intermittency problem
 With solar, the news is even more exciting! The best projections 14 years ago were that we would install one gigawatt per year by 2010
 When 2010 came around, we beat that mark by 17 times over
 Last year, we beat it by 58 times over
 This year, we're on track to beat it 68 times over
 When I came to this stage 10 years ago, this is where it was
 We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough in the emergence of these exponential curves
And the cost has come down 10 percent per year for 30 years
 And it's continuing to come down
Now, the business community has certainly noticed this, because it's crossing the grid parity point
 Cheaper solar penetration rates are beginning to rise
 Grid parity is understood as that line, that threshold, below which renewable electricity is cheaper than electricity from burning fossil fuels
 That threshold is a little bit like the difference between 32 degrees Fahrenheit and 33 degrees Fahrenheit, or zero and one Celsius
 It's a difference of more than one degree, it's the difference between ice and water
 And it's the difference between markets that are frozen up, and liquid flows of capital into new opportunities for investment
 This is the biggest new business opportunity in the history of the world, and two-thirds of it is in the private sector
 We are seeing an explosion of new investment
 Starting in 2010, investments globally in renewable electricity generation surpassed fossils
 The gap has been growing ever since
 The projections for the future are even more dramatic, even though fossil energy is now still subsidized at a rate 40 times larger than renewables
 And by the way, if you add the projections for nuclear on here, particularly if you assume that the work many are doing to try to break through to safer and more acceptable, more affordable forms of nuclear, this could change even more dramatically
So is there any precedent for such a rapid adoption of a new technology? Well, there are many, but let's look at cell phones
 In 1980, AT&T, then Ma Bell, commissioned McKinsey to do a global market survey of those clunky new mobile phones that appeared then
 "How many can we sell by the year 2000?" they asked
 McKinsey came back and said, "900,000
" And sure enough, when the year 2000 arrived, they did sell 900,000 -- in the first three days
So, why were they not only wrong, but way wrong? I've asked that question myself, "Why?"
And I think the answer is in three parts
 First, the cost came down much faster than anybody expected, even as the quality went up
 And low-income countries, places that did not have a landline grid -- they leap-frogged to the new technology
 The big expansion has been in the developing counties
 So what about the electricity grids in the developing world? Well, not so hot
 There are more people without any electricity at all in India than the entire population of the United States of America
 So now we're getting this: solar panels on grass huts and new business models that make it affordable
 Muhammad Yunus financed this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit
 This is a village market
 Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying country in the world: two systems per minute on average, night and day
 And we have all we need: enough energy from the Sun comes to the earth every hour to supply the full world's energy needs for an entire year
 It's actually a little bit less than an hour
 So the answer to the second question, "Can we change?" is clearly "Yes
"
Last question, "Will we change?" Paris really was a breakthrough, some of the provisions are binding and the regular reviews will matter a lot
 But nations aren't waiting, they're going ahead
 China has already announced that starting next year, they're adopting a nationwide cap and trade system
 They will likely link up with the European Union
 The United States has already been changing
 All of these coal plants were proposed in the next 10 years and canceled
 All of these existing coal plants were retired
 All of these coal plants have had their retirement announced
 All of them -- canceled
 We are moving forward
 Last year -- if you look at all of the investment in new electricity generation in the United States, almost three-quarters was from renewable energy, mostly wind and solar
 The only question is: how long will it take to get there? So, it matters that a lot of people are organizing to insist on this change
 Many thousands, tens of thousands, marched in cities around the world
 As I said before, we are going to win this
I'll finish with this story
 When I was 13 years old, I heard that proposal by President Kennedy to land a person on the Moon and bring him back safely in 10 years
 And I heard adults of that day and time say, "That's reckless, expensive, may well fail
We now have a moral challenge that is in the tradition of others that we have faced
" When the abolitionists started their movement, they met with no after no after no
 The Women's Suffrage and Women's Rights Movement met endless no's, until finally, there was a yes
 The Civil Rights Movement, the movement against apartheid, and more recently, the movement for gay and lesbian rights here in the United States and elsewhere
 After the final "no" comes a "yes
"
When any great moral challenge is ultimately resolved into a binary choice between what is right and what is wrong, the outcome is fore-ordained because of who we are as human beings
 Ninety-nine percent of us, that is where we are now and it is why we're going to win this
 We have everything we need
Thank you very much
 You've got this incredible combination of skills
 You've got this scientist mind that can understand the full range of issues, and the ability to turn it into the most vivid language
 No one else can do that, that's why you led this thing
 It was amazing to see it 10 years ago, it was amazing to see it now
 Well, you're nice to say that, Chris
 But honestly, I have a lot of really good friends in the scientific community who are incredibly patient and who will sit there and explain this stuff to me over and over and over again until I can get it into simple enough language that I can understand it
 And that's the key to trying to communicate
 So, your talk
 First part: terrifying, second part: incredibly hopeful
 How do we know that all those graphs, all that progress, is enough to solve what you showed in the first part?
 But one of the things I've learned is that apparently it matters if a new product or service is more expensive than the incumbent, or cheaper than
 Turns out, it makes a difference if it's cheaper than
And when it crosses that line, then a lot of things really change
 We are regularly surprised by these developments
 The late Rudi Dornbusch, the great economist said, "Things take longer to happen then you think they will, and then they happen much faster than you thought they could
" I really think that's where we are
 Some people are using the phrase "The Solar Singularity" now, meaning when it gets below the grid parity, unsubsidized in most places, then it's the default choice
Now, in one of the presentations yesterday, the jitney thing, there is an effort to use regulations to slow this down
 And I just don't think it's going to work
There's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley, who's the Chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party
 They enlisted her in this effort to put a tax on solar panels and regulations
 And she had just put solar panels on her roof and she didn't understand the request
And so she went and formed an alliance with the Sierra Club and they formed a new organization called the Green Tea Party
And they defeated the proposal
 So, finally, the answer to your question is, this sounds a little corny and maybe it's a cliché, but 10 years ago -- and Christiana referred to this -- there are people in this audience who played an incredibly significant role in generating those exponential curves
 And it didn't work out economically for some of them, but it kick-started this global revolution
 And what people in this audience do now with the knowledge that we are going to win this
 Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful
Thank you so much
 Thank you so much for bringing me back to TED
 Thank you!
What started as a platform for hobbyists is poised to become a multibillion-dollar industry
 Inspection, environmental monitoring, photography and film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones, and their enablers are the capabilities being developed at research facilities around the world
For example, before aerial package delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-meter-tall tower composed of 1,500 bricks in front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France, and several years ago, they started to fly with ropes
 By tethering flying machines, they can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight spaces
 They can also autonomously build tensile structures
 Skills learned include how to carry loads, how to cope with disturbances, and in general, how to interact with the physical world
Today we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on
 Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved with autonomous flight
 Back at our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to locate objects, which then allows us to focus our efforts on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks
 For the demos you will see today, however, we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios, a spin-off from our lab
 Each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be
 The only external commands are high-level ones such as "take off" and "land
This is a so-called tail-sitter
 It's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it
 Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more so than helicopters and variations thereof
 Unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft, however, it is capable of hovering, which has huge advantages for takeoff, landing and general versatility
 There is no free lunch, unfortunately
 One of the limitations with tail-sitters is that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts
 We're developing new control architectures and algorithms that address this limitation
OK
When doing research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that try to get at the heart of a matter
 Helicopters, for example, are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts all conspiring to do you bodily harm
 It turns out that decades ago, skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a tail rudder
 We recently discovered that it could be done with just one
This is the monospinner, the world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine, invented just a few months ago
 It has only one moving part, a propeller
 Even so, it doesn't yet have the sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter, which means that in order to get it to fly, I have to throw it just right
If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality, this machine here, the omnicopter, with its eight propellers, is an exercise in excess
 As a result, it is ambivalent to orientation
 It can move anywhere it wants in space irrespective of where it is facing and even of how it is rotating
 It has its own complexities, mainly having to do with the interacting flows from its eight propellers
 Let's take a look
If flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives, they will need to become extremely safe and reliable
 This machine over here is actually two separate two-propeller flying machines
 This one wants to spin clockwise
 This other one wants to spin counterclockwise
 If anything goes wrong, however -- a motor fails, a propeller fails, electronics, even a battery pack -- the machine can still fly, albeit in a degraded fashion
 We're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves
This last demonstration is an exploration of synthetic swarms
 The large number of autonomous, coordinated entities offers a new palette for aesthetic expression
 Because each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled, there is really no limit to their number
Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up new revolutionary roles for flying machines
The reality is that it is difficult to predict the impact of nascent technology
 And for folks like us, the real reward is the journey and the act of creation
 It's a continual reminder of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is, that it allows creative, clever creatures to sculpt it in such spectacular ways
 The fact that this technology has such huge commercial and economic potential is just icing on the cake

3 billion years ago, in a distant, distant galaxy, two black holes locked into a spiral, falling inexorably towards each other and collided, converting three Suns' worth of stuff into pure energy in a tenth of a second
 For that brief moment in time, the glow was brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies in all of the known Universe
 It was a very big bang
But they didn't release their energy in light
 All that energy was pumped into the fabric of space and time itself, making the Universe explode in gravitational waves
Let me give you a sense of the timescale at work here
 1
 Since then, Earth has made and evolved corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and even -- God save us -- the Internet
 And about 25 years ago, a particularly audacious set of people -- Rai Weiss at MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever at Caltech -- decided that it would be really neat to build a giant laser detector with which to search for the gravitational waves from things like colliding black holes
Now, most people thought they were nuts
 But enough people realized that they were brilliant nuts that the US National Science Foundation decided to fund their crazy idea
 So after decades of development, construction and imagination and a breathtaking amount of hard work, they built their detector, called LIGO: The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
For the last several years, LIGO's been undergoing a huge expansion in its accuracy, a tremendous improvement in its detection ability
 It's now called Advanced LIGO as a result
 And on September 14 of 2015, just days after the detector had gone live, the gravitational waves from those colliding black holes passed through the Earth
 And they passed through you and me
 There's two moments in my life more emotionally intense than that
 One is the birth of my daughter
 The other is when I had to say goodbye to my father when he was terminally ill
 You know, it was the payoff of my career, basically
 Everything I'd been working on -- it's no longer science fiction! 
So let me take a moment to tell you what I mean by a gravitational wave
 A gravitational wave is a ripple in the shape of space and time
 As the wave passes by, it stretches space and everything in it in one direction, and compresses it in the other
 This has led to countless instructors of general relativity doing a really silly dance to demonstrate in their classes on general relativity
"
So the trouble with gravitational waves is that they're very weak; they're preposterously weak
 For example, the waves that hit us on September 14 -- and yes, every single one of you stretched and compressed under the action of that wave -- when the waves hit, they stretched the average person by one part in 10 to the 21
 That's a decimal place, 20 zeroes, and a one
 That's why everyone thought the LIGO people were nuts
 Even with a laser detector five kilometers long -- and that's already crazy -- they would have to measure the length of those detectors to less than one thousandth of the radius of the nucleus of an atom
 But physicists are ingenious, and with the support of a broad lay public, all obstacles will surely be overcome
" Thorne published that in 1973, 42 years before he succeeded
Now, coming back to LIGO, Scott likes to say that LIGO acts like an ear more than it does like an eye
 I want to explain what that means
 Visible light has a wavelength, a size, that's much smaller than the things around you, the features on people's faces, the size of your cell phone
Sound is different
 Audible sound has a wavelength that can be up to 50 feet long
 And that makes it really difficult -- in fact, in practical purposes, impossible -- to make an image of something you really care about
 Your child's face
 That's Alice talking
 That's Bob interrupting
 Silly Bob
So, the same is true of gravitational waves
 We can't use them to make simple images of things out in the Universe
 But by listening to changes in the amplitude and frequency of those waves, we can hear the story that those waves are telling
 So if we convert the wave patterns into pressure waves and air, into sound, we can literally hear the Universe speaking to us
 For example, listening to gravity, just in this way, can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, something my colleague Scott has spent an awful lot of time thinking about
 So on September 14, 2015, a date that's definitely going to live in my memory, LIGO heard this:
So if you know how to listen, that is the sound of --
 two black holes, each of about 30 solar masses, that were whirling around at a rate comparable to what goes on in your blender
 It's worth pausing here to think about what that means
 Just imagine the power of that
 It's fantastic
 And we know it because we heard it
That's the lasting importance of LIGO
 It's an entirely new way to observe the Universe that we've never had before
 It's a way that lets us hear the Universe and hear the invisible
And there's a lot out there that we can't see -- in practice or even in principle
 So supernova, for example: I would love to know why very massive stars explode in supernovae
 They're very useful; we've learned a lot about the Universe from them
 The problem is, all the interesting physics happens in the core, and the core is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron and carbon and silicon
 We'll never see through it, it's opaque to light
 Gravitational waves go through iron as if it were glass -- totally transparent
 The Big Bang: I would love to be able to explore the first few moments of the Universe, but we'll never see them, because the Big Bang itself is obscured by its own afterglow
 With gravitational waves, we should be able to see all the way back to the beginning
 Perhaps most importantly, I'm positive that there are things out there that we've never seen that we may never be able to see and that we haven't even imagined -- things that we'll only discover by listening
And in fact, even in that very first event, LIGO found things that we didn't expect
 Here's my colleague and one of the key members of the LIGO collaboration, Matt Evans, my colleague at MIT, addressing exactly that:
 The kinds of stars which produce the black holes that we observed here are the dinosaurs of the Universe
 They're these massive things that are old, from prehistoric times, and the black holes are kind of like the dinosaur bones with which we do this archeology
 So it lets us really get a whole nother angle on what's out there in the Universe and how the stars came to be, and in the end, of course, how we came to be out of this whole mess
 Our job is to dream up and build new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories -- on the ground, in space
 I mean, what could be more glorious than listening to the Big Bang itself? Our job now is to dream big
 Dream with us
Thank you
 For one year, I would say yes to all the things that scared me
 Anything that made me nervous, took me out of my comfort zone, I forced myself to say yes to
 Did I want to speak in public? No, but yes
 Did I want to be on live TV? No, but yes
 Did I want to try acting? No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes
And a crazy thing happened: the very act of doing the thing that scared me undid the fear, made it not scary
 It's amazing, the power of one word
 "Yes" changed my life
 "Yes" changed me
 But there was one particular yes that affected my life in the most profound way, in a way I never imagined, and it started with a question from my toddler
I have these three amazing daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson, and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as "honey
"
" And that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family
 I made a vow that from now on, every time one of my children asks me to play, no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I say yes, every single time
 I'm not perfect at it, but I try hard to practice it
 And it's had a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family
 But it's also had a stunning side effect, and it wasn't until recently that I fully understood it, that I understood that saying yes to playing with my children likely saved my career
See, I have what most people would call a dream job
 I'm a writer
 I imagine
 I make stuff up for a living
 No
 I'm a titan
 Dream job
 I create television
 I executive produce television
 I make television, a great deal of television
 In one way or another, this TV season, I'm responsible for bringing about 70 hours of programming to the world
 Four television programs, 70 hours of TV --
 Each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before
 The budget for one episode of network television can be anywhere from three to six million dollars
 Let's just say five
 In America, my television shows are back to back to back on Thursday night
 Around the world, my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages for an audience of 30 million people
 My brain is global, and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV are shows I personally created and not just produced, so on top of everything else, I need to find time, real quiet, creative time, to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories
 Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four, 350 million dollars, campfires burning all over the world
 You know who else is doing that? Nobody, so like I said, I'm a titan
 Dream job
Now, I don't tell you this to impress you
 I tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word "writer
" I tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard, whether you run a company or a country or a classroom or a store or a home, take me seriously when I talk about working, so you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day, so you'll hear me when I say that I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming
 It's all job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat, no tears
 I work a lot, very hard, and I love it
When I'm hard at work, when I'm deep in it, there is no other feeling
 It is manning the troops
 It is running a marathon
 It is being Beyoncé
 And it is all of those things at the same time
 I love working
 It is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal and cruel and judicious, and what makes it all so good is the hum
 There is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good
 A hum begins in my brain, and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road, and I could drive it forever
 And a lot of people, when I try to explain the hum, they assume that I'm talking about the writing, that my writing brings me joy
 And don't get me wrong, it does
 But the hum -- it wasn't until I started making television that I started working, working and making and building and creating and collaborating, that I discovered this thing, this buzz, this rush, this hum
 The hum is more than writing
 The hum is action and activity
 The hum is a drug
 The hum is music
 The hum is light and air
 The hum is God's whisper right in my ear
 And when you have a hum like that, you can't help but strive for greatness
 That feeling, you can't help but strive for greatness at any cost
 That's called the hum
 Maybe it's called ego
 Maybe it's just fear of failure
 I just know that I'm not built for failure, and I just know that I love the hum
 I just know that I want to tell you I'm a titan, and I know that I don't want to question it
 the more successful I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more barriers broken, the more work there is to do, the more balls in the air, the more eyes on me, the more history stares, the more expectations there are
 The more I work to be successful, the more I need to work
 And what did I say about work? I love working, right? The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the hum
 I like that hum
 I love that hum
 I need that hum
 Am I nothing but that hum?
And then the hum stopped
 The hum stopped
Now, my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working titan
 Harper tells people, "My mom won't be there, but you can text my nanny
" And Emerson says, "Honey, I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand
" They're children of a titan
 They're baby titans
 They were 12, 3, and 1 when the hum stopped
 I stopped loving work
 I couldn't restart the engine
 The hum would not come back
 I was doing the same things I always did, all the same titan work, 15-hour days, working straight through the weekends, no regrets, never surrender, a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits, full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever
 But there was no hum
 Inside me was silence
 Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time, sometimes four
 I was the perfect titan
 I was a titan you could take home to your mother
 All the colors were the same, and I was no longer having any fun
 And it was my life
 It was all I did
 I was the hum, and the hum was me
 So what do you do when the thing you do, the work you love, starts to taste like dust?
Now, I know somebody's out there thinking, "Cry me a river, stupid writer titan lady
"
But you know, you do, if you make, if you work, if you love what you do, being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, being a painter, being Bill Gates, if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum, if you know the hum, if you know what the hum feels like, if you have been to the hum, when the hum stops, who are you? What are you? What am I? Am I still a titan? If the song of my heart ceases to play, can I survive in the silence?
 I'm on my way out the door, I'm late, and she says, "Momma, wanna play?"
" She's not calling everyone "honey" anymore
 When did that happen? I'm missing it, being a titan and mourning my hum, and here she is changing right before my eyes
 And so she says, "Momma, wanna play?" And I say, "Yes
" There's nothing special about it
 We play, and we're joined by her sisters, and there's a lot of laughing, and I give a dramatic reading from the book Everybody Poops
And yet, it is extraordinary, because in my pain and my panic, in the homelessness of my humlessness, I have nothing to do but pay attention
 I focus
 I am still
 The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note does not exist
It's all peace and simplicity
 I can barely believe I'm breathing
 And I am happy
 Something in me loosens
 A door in my brain swings open, and a rush of energy comes
 And it's not instantaneous, but it happens, it does happen
 Not the hum, but a hum
And now I feel like I know a very magical secret
 Well, let's not get carried away
 That's all it is
 No magic
 It's just love
 It's just something we forgot
 If I have to ask you who I am, if I have to tell you who I am, if I describe myself in terms of shows and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is, I have forgotten what the real hum is
 The hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific
 The hum is joy-specific
 The hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life
 The real hum is confidence and peace
 The real hum ignores the stare of history, and the balls in the air, and the expectation, and the pressure
 The real hum is God's whisper in my ear, but maybe God was whispering the wrong words, because which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan?
It's just love
 We could all use a little more love, a lot more love
 Any time my child asks me to play, I will say yes
 I make it a firm rule for one reason, to give myself permission, to free me from all of my workaholic guilt
 It's a law, so I don't have a choice, and I don't have a choice, not if I want to feel the hum
I wish it were that easy, but I'm not good at playing
 I don't like it
 The truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face
 I don't like playing
 I like working more than I like being at home
 Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle, because what kind of person likes working more than being at home?
 I mean, let's be honest, I call myself a titan
 I've got issues
And one of those issues isn't that I am too relaxed
We run around the yard, up and back and up and back
 We have 30-second dance parties
 We sing show tunes
 I blow bubbles and they pop them
 And I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time
 But it is OK
 I play and I play until I begin to wonder why we ever stop playing in the first place
You can do it too, say yes every time your child asks you to play
 Are you thinking that maybe I'm an idiot in diamond shoes? You're right, but you can still do this
 You have time
You only need 15 minutes
 My two- and four-year-old only ever want to play with me for about 15 minutes or so before they think to themselves they want to do something else
15 minutes is all you need
 I can totally pull off 15 minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day
 Uninterrupted is the key
 No cell phone, no laundry, no anything
 You have a busy life
 You have to get dinner on the table
 You have to force them to bathe
 But you can do 15 minutes
 My kids are my happy place, they're my world, but it doesn't have to be your kids, the fuel that feeds your hum, the place where life feels more good than not good
 It's not about playing with your kids, it's about joy
 It's about playing in general
 Give yourself the 15 minutes
 Just figure it out and play in that arena
I'm not perfect at it
 In fact, I fail as often as I succeed, seeing friends, reading books, staring into space
 "Wanna play?" starts to become shorthand for indulging myself in ways I'd given up on right around the time I got my first TV show, right around the time I became a titan-in-training, right around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown
 15 minutes? What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention for 15 minutes? Turns out, nothing
 The very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return, as if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away
 Work doesn't work without play
It takes a little time, but after a few months, one day the floodgates open and there's a rush, and I find myself standing in my office filled with an unfamiliar melody, full on groove inside me, and around me, and it sends me spinning with ideas, and the humming road is open, and I can drive it and drive it, and I love working again
 But now, I like that hum, but I don't love that hum
 I am not that hum
 That hum is not me, not anymore
 I am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends
 I am that hum
 Life's hum
 Love's hum
 Work's hum is still a piece of me, it is just no longer all of me, and I am so grateful
 And I don't give a crap about being a titan, because I have never once seen a titan play Red Rover, Red Rover
 The more I play, the happier I am, and the happier my kids are
 The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother
 The more I play, the better I work
 The more I play, the more I feel the hum, the nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running, the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum, the other hum, the real hum, life's hum
 The more I feel that hum, the more this strange, quivering, uncocooned, awkward, brand new, alive non-titan feels like me
 The more I feel that hum, the more I know who I am
 I'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine
 That part of the job, that's living the dream
 That's the dream of the job
 Because a dream job should be a little bit dreamy
 Titans need not apply
Thank you
And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want to talk to them?
You know, it used to be that in order to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady": Stick to the weather and your health
 But these days, with climate change and anti-vaxxing, those subjects --
are not safe either
 So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential to devolve into an argument, where our politicians can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately for it and against it, it's not normal
 Pew Research did a study of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment, we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history
 And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe
 Again, that means we're not listening to each other
 A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way, we lost that balance
Now, part of that is due to technology
 The smartphones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could grab them really quickly
 And many of them, almost most of them, are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face
 There's this great piece in The Atlantic
 And he gave his kids a communication project
 He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes
 And he said this: "I came to realize
"
"I came to realize that conversational competence might be the single most overlooked skill we fail to teach
 Kids spend hours each day engaging with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal communications skills
 It might sound like a funny question, but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain coherent, confident conversation?"
Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers
 I talk to people that I don't like
 But I still have a great conversation with them
 So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen
 So I want you to forget all of that
 It is crap
There is no reason to learn how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention
Now, I actually use the exact same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life
 Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time, without getting bored, and, please God, without offending anybody
We've all had really great conversations
 We've had them before
 We know what it's like
 The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood
 There is no reason why most of your interactions can't be like that
So I have 10 basic rules
 I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations
 And I don't mean just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys or whatever is in your hand
 I mean, be present
 Be in that moment
 Don't think about what you're going to have for dinner
 If you want to get out of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it and half out of it
 Don't pontificate
Now, there's a really good reason why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring
 Totally predictable
 The famed therapist M
 Scott Peck said that true listening requires a setting aside of oneself
 And sometimes that means setting aside your personal opinion
 He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener
 Again, assume that you have something to learn
" I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something
 Use open-ended questions
 In this case, take a cue from journalists
 Start your questions with who, what, when, where, why or how
 If you put in a complicated question, you're going to get a simple answer out
 If I ask you, "Were you terrified?" you're going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence, which is "terrified," and the answer is "Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't
" "Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry
" Let them describe it
 They're the ones that know
 Try asking them things like, "What was that like?" "How did that feel?" Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get a much more interesting response
 Go with the flow
 That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind
 We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking for several minutes and then the host comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere, or it's already been answered
 That means the host probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really clever question, and he was just bound and determined to say that
 And we do the exact same thing
And we stop listening
 Stories and ideas are going to come to you
 You need to let them come and let them go
 If you don't know, say that you don't know
 Now, people on the radio, especially on NPR, are much more aware that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure
 Do that
 Err on the side of caution
 Talk should not be cheap
 Don't equate your experience with theirs
 If they're talking about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time you lost a family member
 If they're talking about the trouble they're having at work, don't tell them about how much you hate your job
 It's not the same
 It is never the same
 All experiences are individual
 You don't need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered
 Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once what his IQ was, and he said, "I have no idea
 People who brag about their IQs are losers
"
 Especially in work conversations or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it over and over
 Stay out of the weeds
 Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling to come up with in your mind
 They don't care
 What they care about is you
 They care about what you're like, what you have in common
 Leave them out
 Listen
 I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most, the number one most important skill that you could develop
 Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, "If your mouth is open, you're not learning
" And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man ever listened his way out of a job
"
Why do we not listen to each other? Number one, we'd rather talk
 When I'm talking, I'm in control
 I don't have to hear anything I'm not interested in
 I can bolster my own identity
 But there's another reason: We get distracted
 The average person talks at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute
 So our minds are filling in those other 275 words
 And look, I know, it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that, you're not in a conversation
You have to listen to one another
 Stephen Covey said it very beautifully
 He said, "Most of us don't listen with the intent to understand
 We listen with the intent to reply
"
[A good conversation is like a miniskirt; short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject
 -- My Sister]
 All of this boils down to the same basic concept, and it is this one: Be interested in other people
You know, I grew up with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual in my home
 People would come over to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave, my mother would come over to us, and she'd say, "Do you know who that was? She was the runner-up to Miss America
 He was the mayor of Sacramento
 She won a Pulitzer Prize
 He's a Russian ballet dancer
" And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden, amazing thing about them
 And honestly, I think it's what makes me a better host
 I keep my mouth shut as often as I possibly can, I keep my mind open, and I'm always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed
You do the same thing
 Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly, be prepared to be amazed
Thanks
So I'm a neurosurgeon
 And like most of my colleagues, I have to deal, every day, with human tragedies
 I realize how your life can change from one second to the other after a major stroke or after a car accident
 And what is very frustrating for us neurosurgeons is to realize that unlike other organs of the body, the brain has very little ability for self-repair
What is a functional neurosurgeon? It's a doctor who is trying to improve a neurological function through different surgical strategies
 You've certainly heard of one of the famous ones called deep brain stimulation, where you implant an electrode in the depths of the brain in order to modulate a circuit of neurons to improve a neurological function
 It's really an amazing technology in that it has improved the destiny of patients with Parkinson's disease, with severe tremor, with severe pain
 However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-repair
 And the dream of functional neurosurgeons is to repair the brain
And I would like to show you that we are very close to this
 And that with a little bit of help, the brain is able to help itself
So the story started 15 years ago
 At that time, I was a chief resident working days and nights in the emergency room
 So instead of throwing away these pieces of swollen brain, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, who is a colleague of mine, a biologist, to study them
What do I mean by that? We wanted to grow cells from these pieces of tissue
 It's not an easy task
 So you need to find the right nutrients, the warmth, the humidity and all the nice environments to make them thrive
 And after many attempts, Jean-François did it
 Why? Because this looks exactly the same as a stem cell culture, with large green cells surrounding small, immature cells
 And you may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells, able to turn into any type of cell of the body
 The adult brain has stem cells, but they're very rare and they're located in deep and small niches in the depths of the brain
And there was another intriguing observation: Regular stem cells are very active cells -- cells that divide, divide, divide very quickly
 They divide slowly, and after a few weeks of culture, they even died
 So we were in front of a strange new cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently
And it took us a long time to understand where they came from
 They come from these cells
 These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells
 They represent four percent of your cortical brain cells
 When you were fetuses, they helped your brain to fold itself
 But why do they stay in your head? This, we don't know
 We think that they may participate in brain repair because we find them in higher concentration close to brain lesions
 But it's not so sure
 But there is one clear thing -- that from these cells, we got our stem cell culture
 And we were in front of a potential new source of cells to repair the brain
 And we had to prove this
So to prove it, we decided to design an experimental paradigm
 And then label them, to put color in them in order to be able to track them in the brain
 And the last step was to re-implant them in the same individual
 We call these autologous grafts -- autografts
So the first question we had, "What will happen if we re-implant these cells in a normal brain, and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in a lesioned brain?" Thanks to the help of professor Eric Rouiller, we worked with monkeys
So in the first-case scenario, we re-implanted the cells in the normal brain and what we saw is that they completely disappeared after a few weeks, as if they were taken from the brain, they go back home, the space is already busy, they are not needed there, so they disappear
In the second-case scenario, we performed the lesion, we re-implanted exactly the same cells, and in this case, the cells remained -- and they became mature neurons
But we could not stop here, of course
 Do these cells also help a monkey to recover after a lesion? So for that, we trained monkeys to perform a manual dexterity task
 They had to retrieve food pellets from a tray
 They were very good at it
 And when they had reached a plateau of performance, we did a lesion in the motor cortex corresponding to the hand motion
 So the monkeys were plegic, they could not move their hand anymore
 And exactly the same as humans would do, they spontaneously recovered to a certain extent, exactly the same as after a stroke
 Patients are completely plegic, and then they try to recover due to a brain plasticity mechanism, they recover to a certain extent, exactly the same for the monkey
 He's at about 40 to 50 percent of his previous performance before the lesion
 He's not so accurate, not so quick
 And look now, when we re-impant the cells: Two months after re-implantation, the same individual
It was also very exciting results for us, I tell you
 We know that we can apply them in other neuropathological models, like Parkinson's disease, for example
 But our dream is still to implant them in humans
 And I really hope that I'll be able to show you soon that the human brain is giving us the tools to repair itself
Thank you
 Jocelyne, this is amazing, and I'm sure that right now, there are several dozen people in the audience, possibly even a majority, who are thinking, "I know somebody who can use this
" I do, in any case
 And of course the question is, what are the biggest obstacles before you can go into human clinical trials?
  So, from these exciting results, you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to be able to go through these kind of trials
 Which is understandable, the brain is delicate, etc
 Yes, it is, but it takes a long time and a lot of patience and almost a professional team to do it, you know?
 Will the regulation allow us to do it soon? And then, you have to perform this kind of study in a small group of patients
 And then you have to deploy this to a multicentric trial
 You have to really prove first that it's useful before offering this treatment up for everybody
 JB: Of course
 Jocelyne, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this
 BG: Thank you
15 years ago, I volunteered to participate in a research study that involved a genetic test
 When I arrived at the clinic to be tested, I was handed a questionnaire
I wasn't quite sure how to answer the question
 Was it aimed at measuring the diversity of research participants' social backgrounds? In that case, I would answer with my social identity, and check the box for "black
" But what if the researchers were interested in investigating some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits? In that case, wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry, which is just as much European as African? And how could they make scientific findings about my genes if I put down my social identity as a black woman? After all, I consider myself a black woman with a white father rather than a white woman with a black mother entirely for social reasons
 Which racial identity I check has nothing to do with my genes
 Well, despite the obvious importance of this question to the study's scientific validity, I was told, "Don't worry about it, just put down however you identify yourself
That personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing got me thinking: Where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions?
Well, I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice
 It shapes physicians' diagnoses, measurements, treatments, prescriptions, even the very definition of diseases
 And the more I found out, the more disturbed I became
Sociologists like me have long explained that race is a social construction
 As a legal scholar, I've also studied how lawmakers, not biologists, have invented the legal definitions of races
And it's not just the view of social scientists
 You remember when the map of the human genome was unveiled at a White House ceremony in June 2000? President Bill Clinton famously declared, "I believe one of the great truths to emerge from this triumphant expedition inside the human genome is that in genetic terms, human beings, regardless of race, are more than 99
9 percent the same
Francis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project and now heads NIH, echoed President Clinton
 "I am happy that today, the only race we're talking about is the human race
"
Take the estimate of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR
 Doctors routinely interpret GFR, this important indicator of kidney function, by race
 As you can see in this lab test, the exact same creatinine level, the concentration in the blood of the patient, automatically produces a different GFR estimate depending on whether or not the patient is African-American
 Why?
I've been told it's based on an assumption that African-Americans have more muscle mass than people of other races
 But what sense does it make for a doctor to automatically assume I have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder? Wouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence-based to determine the muscle mass of individual patients just by looking at them?
Well, doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut
 It's a crude but convenient proxy for more important factors, like muscle mass, enzyme level, genetic traits they just don't have time to look for
 But race is a bad proxy
 In many cases, race adds no relevant information at all
 It's just a distraction
 But race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures
 It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms, family illnesses, their history, their own illnesses they might have -- all more evidence-based than the patient's race
Doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors they take into account, but there are numerous medical tests, like the GFR, that use race categorically to treat black, white, Asian patients differently just because of their race
 Black and Latino patients are twice as likely to receive no pain medication as whites for the same painful long bone fractures because of stereotypes that black and brown people feel less pain, exaggerate their pain, and are predisposed to drug addiction
The Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race-specific medicine
 It's a pill called BiDil to treat heart failure in self-identified African-American patients
 A cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics, but it became convenient for commercial reasons to market the drug to black patients
 The FDA then allowed the company, the drug company, to test the efficacy in a clinical trial that only included African-American subjects
 It speculated that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor that affects heart disease or response to drugs
 But think about the dangerous message it sent, that black people's bodies are so substandard, a drug tested in them is not guaranteed to work in other patients
 One elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted, "Give me what the white people are taking!"
And if you find race-specific medicine surprising, wait until you learn that many doctors in the United States still use an updated version of a diagnostic tool that was developed by a physician during the slavery era, a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked to justifications for slavery
Dr
 Samuel Cartwright graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School
 He practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War, and he was a well-known expert on what was then called "Negro medicine
" He promoted the racial concept of disease, that people of different races suffer from different diseases and experience common diseases differently
 Cartwright argued in the 1850s that slavery was beneficial for black people for medical reasons
 He claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites, forced labor was good for them
 He wrote in a medical journal, "It is the red vital blood sent to the brain that liberates their minds when under the white man's control, and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom
" To support this theory, Cartwright helped to perfect a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs
Today, doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim the black people as a race have lower lung capacity than white people
 Some even use a modern day spirometer that actually has a button labeled "race" so the machine adjusts the measurement for each patient according to his or her race
"
The problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients
 Its focus on innate racial differences in disease diverts attention and resources from the social determinants that cause appalling racial gaps in health: lack of access to high-quality medical care; food deserts in poor neighborhoods; exposure to environmental toxins; high rates of incarceration; and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination
You see, race is not a biological category that naturally produces these health disparities because of genetic difference
 Race is a social category that has staggering biological consequences, but because of the impact of social inequality on people's health
 Yet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health can be found in a race-specific pill
 It's much easier and more lucrative to market a technological fix for these gaps in health than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them
The reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine isn't just because it's bad medicine
 Despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we've been learning about, there's a failure of imagination when it comes to race
 Would you imagine with me, just a moment: What would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race? Suppose they rejected an 18th-century classification system and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge of human genetic diversity and unity, that human beings cannot be categorized into biological races? What if, instead of using race as a crude proxy for some more important factor, doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor? What if doctors joined the forefront of a movement to end the structural inequities caused by racism, not by genetic difference?
Race medicine is bad medicine, it's poor science and it's a false interpretation of humanity
Thank you
Thank you
 Thanks
So I come from the tallest people on the planet -- the Dutch
 It hasn't always been this way
 In fact, all across the globe, people have been gaining height
 And scientists have a lot of theories about why this is, but almost all of them involve nutrition, namely the increase of dairy and meat
In the last 50 years, global meat consumption has more than quadrupled, from 71 million tons to 310 million tons
 Something similar has been going on with milk and eggs
 In every society where incomes have risen, so has protein consumption
 And we know that globally, we are getting richer
 And as the middle class is on the rise, so is our global population, from 7 billion of us today to 9
7 billion by 2050, which means that by 2050, we are going to need at least 70 percent more protein than what is available to humankind today
 And the latest prediction of the UN puts that population number, by the end of this century, at 11 billion, which means that we are going to need a lot more protein
Currently, our ocean serves as the main source of animal protein
 Over 2
6 billion people depend on it every single day
 At the same time, our global fisheries are two-and-a-half times larger than what our oceans can sustainably support, meaning that humans take far more fish from the ocean than the oceans can naturally replace
WWF recently published a report showing that just in the last 40 years, our global marine life has been slashed in half
 And another recent report suggests that of our largest predatory species, such as swordfish and bluefin tuna, over 90 percent has disappeared since the 1950s
And there are a lot of great, sustainable fishing initiatives across the planet working towards better practices and better-managed fisheries
 But ultimately, all of these initiatives are working towards keeping current catch constant
 It's unlikely, even with the best-managed fisheries, that we are going to be able to take much more from the ocean than we do today
We have to stop plundering our oceans the way we have
 We need to alleviate the pressure on it
 And we are at a point where if we push much harder for more produce, we might face total collapse
 Our current systems are not going to feed a growing global population
So how do we fix this? What's the world going to look like in just 35 short years when there's 2
7 billion more of us sharing the same resources? We could all become vegan
 Sounds like a great idea, but it's not realistic and it's impossibly hard to mandate globally
People are eating animal protein whether we like it or not
 And suppose we fail to change our ways and continue on the current path, failing to meet demands
The World Health Organization recently reported that 800 million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage, which is due to that same growing, global population and the declining access to resources like water, energy and land
 It takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest, riots and further malnutrition
 People are hungry, and we are running dangerously low on natural resources
We must do better and there is a solution
 And that solution lies in aquaculture -- the farming of fish, plants like seaweed, shellfish and crustaceans
 As the great ocean hero Jacques Cousteau once said, "We must start using the ocean as farmers instead of hunters
 That's what civilization is all about -- farming instead of hunting
" Fish is the last food that we hunt
And why is it that we keep hearing phrases like, "Life's too short for farmed fish," or, "Wild-caught, of course!" over fish that we know virtually nothing about? We don't know what it ate during its lifetime, and we don't know what pollution it encounters
 And if it was a large predatory species, it might have gone through the coast of Fukushima yesterday
 We don't know
 Very few people realize the traceability in fisheries never goes beyond the hunter that caught the wild animal
 It's healthy, it prevents heart disease, it provides key amino acids and key fatty acids like Omega-3s, which is very different from almost any other type of meat
Think about it -- most animal farming is pretty monotonous
 Cow is cow, sheep is sheep, pig's pig, and poultry -- turkey, duck, chicken -- pretty much sums it up
 not that Western supermarkets reflect that on their shelves, but that's beside that point
And you can farm fish in a very healthy manner that's good for us, good for the planet and good for the fish
 I know I sound fish-obsessed --
 My brilliant partner and wife, Amy Novograntz, and I got involved in aquaculture a couple of years ago
 We actually met on Mission Blue I in the Galapagos
 We fell in love, got married and we came away really inspired, thinking we really want to do something about ocean conservation -- something that was meant to last, that could make a real difference and something that we could do together
Little did we expect that that would lead us to fish farming
 But a few months after we got off the boat, we got to a meeting at Conservation International, where the Director General of WorldFish was talking about aquaculture, asking a room full of environmentalists to stop turning from it, realize what was going on and to really get involved because aquaculture has the potential to be just what our oceans and populations need
We were stunned when we heard the stats that we didn't know more about this industry already and excited about the chance to help get it right
And to talk about stats -- right now, the amount of fish consumed globally, wild catch and farmed combined, is twice the tonnage of the total amount of beef produced on planet earth last year
 Every single fishing vessel combined, small and large, across the globe, together produce about 65 million tons of wild-caught seafood for human consumption
Aquaculture this year, for the first time in history, actually produces more than what we catch from the wild
 Demand is going to go up
 In the next 35 years, we are going to need an additional 85 million tons to meet demand, which is one-and-a-half times as much, almost, as what we catch globally out of our oceans
 An enormous number
It's safe to assume that that's not going to come from the ocean
 It needs to come from farming
 And talk about farming -- for farming you need resources
 As a human needs to eat to grow and stay alive, so does an animal
 A cow needs to eat eight to nine pounds of feed and drink almost 8,000 liters of water to create just one pound of meat
 Experts agree that it's impossible to farm cows for every inhabitant on this planet
 We just don't have enough feed or water
 And fresh water -- planet earth has a very limited supply
 We need something more efficient to keep humankind alive on this planet
And now let's compare that with fish farming
 You can farm one pound of fish with just one pound of feed, and depending on species, even less
 And why is that? Well, that's because fish, first of all, float
 They don't need to stand around all day resisting gravity like we do
 And most fish are cold-blooded -- they don't need to heat themselves
And it needs very little water, which is counterintuitive, but as we say, it swims in it but it hardly drinks it
 Fish are the most resource-efficient animal protein available to humankind, aside from insects
 Sixty-five percent of these fisheries, globally, are badly managed
 It's destroying our oceans
 The worst slavery issues imaginable are connected to it
 Recently, an article came out of Stanford saying that if 50 percent of the world's aquaculture industry would stop using fish meal, our oceans would be saved
 Now think about that for a minute
 But it underlines the impact of our fisheries, and it underlines how interconnected everything is
 Fisheries, aquaculture, deforestation, climate change, food security and so on
In the search for alternatives, the industry, on a massive scale, has reverted to plant-based alternatives like soy, industrial chicken waste, blood meal from slaughterhouses and so on
And we understand where these choices come from, but this is not the right approach
 It's not sustainable, it's not healthy
 Have you ever seen a chicken at the bottom of the ocean? Of course not
 If you feed salmon soy with nothing else, it literally explodes
 Salmon is a carnivore, it has no way to digest soy
Now, fish farming is by far the best animal farming available to humankind
 But it's had a really bad reputation
 There's been excessive use of chemicals, there's been virus and disease transfered to wild populations, ecosystem destruction and pollution, escaped fish breeding with wild populations, altering the overall genetic pool, and then of course, as just mentioned, the unsustainable feed ingredients
 Once you know, you know
 You can't go back
 We really need a transparent food system that we can trust, that produces healthy food
But the good news is that decades of development and research have led to a lot of new technologies and knowledge that allow us to do a lot better
 We can now farm fish without any of these issues
I think of agriculture before the green revolution -- we are at aquaculture and the blue revolution
 Healthy for the people, healthy for the fish, healthy for the planet
Microbes, for example, can be a perfect alternative for high-grade fish meal -- at scale
Insects are the -- well, first of all, the perfect recycling because they're grown on food waste; but second, think of fly-fishing, and you know how logical it actually is to use it as fish feed
 You don't need large tracts of land for it and you don't need to cut down rain forests for it
 And microbes and insects are actually net water producers
This revolution is starting as we speak, it just needs scale
 We can now farm far more species than ever before in controlled, natural conditions, creating happy fish
I imagine, for example, a closed system that's performing more efficiently than insect farming, where you can produce healthy, happy, delicious fish with little or no effluent, almost no energy and almost no water and a natural feed with a minimal footprint
 Or a system where you grow up to 10 species next to each other -- off of each other, mimicking nature
 You need very little feed, very little footprint
There's great technologies popping up all over the globe
 From alternatives to battle disease so we don't need antibiotics and chemicals anymore, to automated feeders that feel when the fish are hungry, so we can save on feed and create less pollution
There's really cool stuff happening all over the globe
 And make no mistake -- all of these things are possible at a cost that's competitive to what a farmer spends today
 Tomorrow, there will be no excuse for anyone to not do the right thing
 And that's what we've been working on the last couple of years, and that's what we need to be working on together -- rethinking everything from the ground up, with a holistic view across the value chain, connecting all these things across the globe, alongside great entrepreneurs that are willing to share a collective vision
Now is the time to create change in this industry and to push it into a sustainable direction
 This industry is still young, much of its growth is still ahead
 It's a big task, but not as far-fetched as you might think
 It's possible
So we need to take pressure off the ocean
 And if we eat an animal, it needs to be one that had a happy and healthy life
We need to have a meal that we can trust, live long lives
 And this is not just for people in San Francisco or Northern Europe -- this is for all of us
 Even in the poorest countries, it's not just about money
 People prefer something fresh and healthy that they can trust over something that comes from far away that they know nothing about
The day will come where people will realize -- no, demand -- farmed fish on their plate that's farmed well and that's farmed healthy -- and refuse anything less
You can help speed this up
 Ask questions when you order seafood
 Where does my fish come from? Who raised it, and what did it eat? Information about where your fish comes from and how it was produced needs to be much more readily available
 And consumers need to put pressure on the aquaculture industry to do the right thing
So every time you order, ask for detail and show that you really care about what you eat and what's been given to you
 And eventually, they will listen
Thank you
On January 26, 2013, a band of al-Qaeda militants entered the ancient city of Timbuktu on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert
 There, they set fire to a medieval library of 30,000 manuscripts written in Arabic and several African languages and ranging in subject from astronomy to geography, history to medicine, including one book which records perhaps the first treatment for male erectile dysfunction
 Unknown in the West, this was the collected wisdom of an entire continent, the voice of Africa at a time when Africa was thought not to have a voice at all
In fact, just before, African scholars had collected a random assortment of old books and left them out for the terrorists to burn
 Today, the collection lies hidden in Bamako, the capital of Mali, moldering in the high humidity
But Africa, and the far-flung corners of the world, are not the only places, or even the main places in which manuscripts that could change the history of world culture are in jeopardy
 Several years ago, I conducted a survey of European research libraries and discovered that, at the barest minimum, there are 60,000 manuscripts pre-1500 that are illegible because of water damage, fading, mold and chemical reagents
What if there were a technology that could recover these lost and unknown works? Imagine worldwide how a trove of hundreds of thousands of previously unknown texts could radically transform our knowledge of the past
 Imagine what unknown classics we would discover which would rewrite the canons of literature, history, philosophy, music -- or, more provocatively, that could rewrite our cultural identities, building new bridges between people and culture
 These are the questions that transformed me from a medieval scholar, a reader of texts, into a textual scientist
What an unsatisfying word "reader" is
 For me, it conjures up images of passivity, of someone sitting idly in an armchair waiting for knowledge to come to him in a neat little parcel
 As an academic, I was a mere reader
 I read and taught the same classics that people had been reading and teaching for hundreds of years -- Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch -- and with every scholarly article that I published I added to human knowledge in ever-diminishing slivers of insight
 What I wanted to be was an archaeologist of the past, a discoverer of literature, an Indiana Jones without the whip -- or, actually, with the whip
 And I wanted it not just for myself but I wanted it for my students as well
 At the time, I was working on "The Chess of Love," the last important long poem of the European Middle Ages never to have been edited
 And it wasn't edited because it existed in only one manuscript which was so badly damaged during the firebombing of Dresden in World War II that generations of scholars had pronounced it lost
 For five years, I had been working with an ultraviolet lamp trying to recover traces of the writing and I'd gone about as far as technology at the time could actually take me
And so I did what many people do
 I went online, and there I learned about how multispectral imaging had been used to recover two lost treatises of the famed Greek mathematician Archimedes from a 13th-century palimpsest
 A palimpsest is a manuscript which has been erased and overwritten
And so, out of the blue, I decided to write to the lead imaging scientist on the Archimedes palimpsest project, Professor Roger Easton, with a plan and a plea
 With his help, I was able to win a grant from the US government to build a transportable, multispectral imaging lab, And with this lab, I transformed what was a charred and faded mess into a new medieval classic
So how does multispectral imaging actually work? Well, the idea behind multispectral imaging is something that anyone who is familiar with infrared night vision goggles will immediately appreciate: that what we can see in the visible spectrum of light is only a tiny fraction of what's actually there
 The same is true with invisible writing
 Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light between the ultraviolet and the infrared, and these are shown down onto the manuscript from above from banks of LEDs, and another multispectral light source which comes up through the individual leaves of the manuscript
 There are about five of these in the world
The results can be spectacular
 You may already have heard of what's been done for the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are slowly gelatinizing
 Using infrared, we've been able to read even the darkest corners of the Dead Sea Scrolls
 You may not be aware, however, of other Biblical texts that are in jeopardy
Here, for example, is a leaf from a manuscript that we imaged, which is perhaps the most valuable Christian Bible in the world
 The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest translation of the Gospels into Latin, and it dates from the first half of the fourth century
 This is the closest we can come to the Bible at the time of the foundation of Christendom under Emperor Constantine, and at the time also of the Council of Nicaea, when the basic creed of Christianity was being agreed upon
 In fact, that purple splotch that you see in the upper left hand corner is Aspergillus, which is a fungus which originates in the unwashed hands of a person with tuberculosis
 Our imaging has enabled me to make the first transcription of this manuscript in 250 years
Having a lab that can travel to collections where it's needed, however, is only part of the solution
 The technology is expensive and very rare, and the imaging and image processing skills are esoteric
 That means that mounting recoveries is beyond the reach of most researchers and all but the wealthiest institutions
 Over the past five years, our team of imaging scientists, scholars and students has travelled to seven different countries and have recovered some of the world's most valuable damaged manuscripts, included the Vercelli Book, which is the oldest book of English, the Black Book of Carmarthen, the oldest book of Welsh, and some of the most valuable earliest Gospels located in what is now the former Soviet Georgia
So, spectral imaging can recover lost texts
 More subtly, though, it can recover a second story behind every object, the story of how, when and by whom a text was created, and, sometimes, what the author was thinking at the time he wrote
 Take, for example, a draft of the Declaration of Independence written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand, which some colleagues of mine imaged a few years ago at the Library of Congress
 Curators had noticed that one word throughout had been scratched out and overwritten
 The word overwritten was "citizens
" Perhaps you can guess what the word underneath was
 "Subjects
" There, ladies and gentlemen, is American democracy evolving under the hand of Thomas Jefferson
Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map, which we imaged at Yale's Beinecke Library
 This was the map that Columbus likely consulted before he traveled to the New World and which gave him his idea of what Asia looked like and where Japan was located
 The problem with this map is that its inks and pigments had so degraded over time that this large, nearly seven-foot map, made the world look like a giant desert
 Until now, we had very little idea, detailed idea, that is, of what Columbus knew of the world and how world cultures were represented
 The main legend of the map was entirely illegible under normal light
 Ultraviolet did very little for it
 Multispectral gave us everything
 In Asia, we learned of monsters with ears so long that they could cover the creature's entire body
 Like starlight, which can convey images of the way the Universe looked in the distant past, so multispectral light can take us back to the first stuttering moments of an object's creation
 Through this lens, we witness the mistakes, the changes of mind, the naïvetés, the uncensored thoughts, the imperfections of the human imagination that allow these hallowed objects and their authors to become more real, that make history closer to us
What about the future? There's so much of the past, and so few people with the skills to rescue it before these objects disappear forever
" Textual science is a marriage of the traditional skills of a literary scholar -- the ability to read old languages and old handwriting, the knowledge of how texts are made in order to be able to place and date them -- with new techniques like imaging science, the chemistry of inks and pigments, computer-aided optical character recognition
 Everyone gathered around, and he read a line from a lost work of the Greek comic dramatist Menander
 In that moment, he became a scholar
Ladies and gentlemen, that is the future of the past
Thank you very much
We've evolved with tools, and tools have evolved with us
 Our ancestors created these hand axes 1
5 million years ago, shaping them to not only fit the task at hand but also their hand
 These sculpting tools have evolved through their use, and each one has a different form which matches its function
 But as tools have become more and more complex, we need more complex controls to control them
 And so designers have become very adept at creating interfaces that allow you to manipulate parameters while you're attending to other things, such as taking a photograph and changing the focus or the aperture
But the computer has fundamentally changed the way we think about tools because computation is dynamic
 So it can do a million different things and run a million different applications
 However, computers have the same static physical form for all of these different applications and the same static interface elements as well
 And I believe that this is fundamentally a problem, because it doesn't really allow us to interact with our hands and capture the rich dexterity that we have in our bodies
 And my belief is that, then, we must need new types of interfaces that can capture these rich abilities that we have and that can physically adapt to us and allow us to interact in new ways
 And so that's what I've been doing at the MIT Media Lab and now at Stanford
So with my colleagues, Daniel Leithinger and Hiroshi Ishii, we created inFORM, where the interface can actually come off the screen and you can physically manipulate it
 Or you can visualize 3D information physically and touch it and feel it to understand it in new ways
 Or interface elements can arise out of the surface and change on demand
 And I believe this represents a new way that we can interact with information, by making it physical
So the question is, how can we use this? Traditionally, urban planners and architects build physical models of cities and buildings to better understand them
 So with Tony Tang at the Media Lab, we created an interface built on inFORM to allow urban planners to design and view entire cities
 And now you can walk around it, but it's dynamic, it's physical, and you can also interact directly
 Or you can look at different views, such as population or traffic information, but it's made physical
 So when we're working together in person, I'm not only looking at your face but I'm also gesturing and manipulating objects, and that's really hard to do when you're using tools like Skype
 And so using inFORM, you can reach out from the screen and manipulate things at a distance
 So we used the pins of the display to represent people's hands, allowing them to actually touch and manipulate objects at a distance
 And you can also manipulate and collaborate on 3D data sets as well, so you can gesture around them as well as manipulate them
 And that allows people to collaborate on these new types of 3D information in a richer way than might be possible with traditional tools
 And so you can also bring in existing objects, and those will be captured on one side and transmitted to the other
 Or you can have an object that's linked between two places, so as I move a ball on one side, the ball moves on the other as well
 And so we do this by capturing the remote user using a depth-sensing camera like a Microsoft Kinect
Now, you might be wondering how does this all work, and essentially, what it is, is 900 linear actuators that are connected to these mechanical linkages that allow motion down here to be propagated in these pins above
 And so we started with a single motor, a single linear actuator, and then we had to design a custom circuit board to control them
 And then we had to make a lot of them
 And so the problem with having 900 of something is that you have to do every step 900 times
 And so that meant that we had a lot of work to do
and had late nights watching movies, eating pizza and screwing in thousands of screws
 You know -- research
 But mobile devices, just like computers, are used for so many different applications
 So you use them to talk on the phone, to surf the web, to play games, to take pictures or even a million different things
 But again, they have the same static physical form for each of these applications
 And so we wanted to know how can we take some of the same interactions that we developed for inFORM and bring them to mobile devices
 Or buttons can emerge from the side that allow you to interact where you want them to be
 Or you can play games and have actual buttons
 And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well
But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change
 So we've used pneumatic actuation to create a morphing device where you can go from something that looks a lot like a phone 
 to a wristband on the go
 So you can make something like a game controller, and then the system will understand what shape it's in and change to that mode
So, where does this point? How do we move forward from here? I think, really, where we are today is in this new age of the Internet of Things, where we have computers everywhere -- they're in our pockets, they're in our walls, they're in almost every device that you'll buy in the next five years
 But what if we stopped thinking about devices and think instead about environments? And so how can we have smart furniture or smart rooms or smart environments or cities that can adapt to us physically, and allow us to do new ways of collaborating with people and doing new types of tasks?
So for the Milan Design Week, we created TRANSFORM, which is an interactive table-scale version of these shape displays, which can move physical objects on the surface; for example, reminding you to take your keys
So, in conclusion, I really think that we need to think about a new, fundamentally different way of interacting with computers
Thank you very much
Our ability to create and sustain economic growth is the defining challenge of our time
Of course there are other challenges -- health care, disease burdens and pandemics, environmental challenges and, of course, radicalized terrorism
 However, to the extent that we can actually solve the economic growth challenge, it will take us a long way to solving the challenges that I've just elucidated
More importantly, unless and until we solve economic growth and create sustainable, long-term economic growth, we'll be unable to address the seemingly intractable challenges that continue to pervade the globe today, whether it's health care, education or economic development
The fundamental question is this: How are we going to create economic growth in advanced and developed economies like the United States and across Europe at a time when they continue to struggle to create economic growth after the financial crisis?
They continue to underperform and to see an erosion in the three key drivers of economic growth: capital, labor and productivity
 In particular, these developed economies continue to see debts and deficits, the decline and erosion of both the quality and quantity of labor and they also see productivity stalling
 Worse than that, countries like India, Russia, South Africa, Brazil and even China are falling below that seven percent number and, in many cases, actually regressing
 With economic growth, countries and societies enter into a virtuous cycle of upward mobility, opportunity and improved living standards
 Without growth, countries contract and atrophy, not just in the annals of economic statistics but also in the meaning of life and how lives are lived
 If growth wanes, the risk to human progress and the risk of political and social instability rises, and societies become dimmer, coarser and smaller
The context matters
 And countries in emerging markets do not need to grow at the same rates as developed countries
Now, I know some of you in this room find this to be a risky proposition
 There are some people here who will turn around and be quite disillusioned by what's happened around the world and basically ascribe that to economic growth
 And looking at the UN's recent statistics and projections that the world will have 11 billion people on the planet before it plateaus in 2100, you're concerned about what that does to natural resources -- arable land, potable water, energy and minerals
 You are also concerned about the degradation of the environment
 And you worry about how man, embodied in the corporate globalist, has become greedy and corrupt
But I'm here to tell you today that economic growth has been the backbone of changes in living standards of millions of people around the world
 And more importantly, it's not just economic growth that has been driven by capitalism
It's really essential here that we understand that fundamentally the critique is not for economic growth per se but what has happened to capitalism
 And as I mentioned a moment ago, the core of the capitalist system has been defined by private actors
 And even this, however, is a very simplistic dichotomy
 Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad
 When in practical experience, capitalism is much more of a spectrum
 And we have countries such as China, which have practiced more state capitalism, and we have countries like the Unites States which are more market capitalist
Our efforts to critique the capitalist system, however, have tended to focus on countries like China that are in fact not blatantly market capitalism
However, there is a real reason and real concern for us to now focus our attentions on purer forms of capitalism, particularly those embodied by the United States
 This is really important because this type of capitalism has increasingly been afforded the critique that it is now fostering corruption and, worse still, it's increasing income inequality -- the idea that the few are benefiting at the expense of the many
The two really critical questions that we need to address is how can we fix capitalism so that it can help create economic growth but at the same time can help to address social ills
 And only after they've maximized their utility do they then decide it's important to provide support to other social contracts
 But nevertheless, this framework -- this two-stage framework -- is the basis from which we must now start to think about how we can improve the capitalist model
I would argue that there are two sides to this challenge
 First of all, we can draw on the right-wing policies to see what could be beneficial for us to think about how we can improve capitalism
In particular, right-leaning policies have tended to focus on things like conditional transfers, where we pay and reward people for doing the things that we actually think can help enhance economic growth
 For example, sending children to school, parents could earn money for that, or getting their children inoculated or immunized, parents could get paid for doing that
Now, quite apart from the debate on whether or not we should be paying people to do what we think they should do anyway, the fact of the matter is that pay for performance has actually yielded some positive results in places like Mexico, in Brazil and also in pilot programs in New York
 Arguments that government should expand its role and responsibility so that it's not so narrowly defined and that government should be much more of an arbiter of the factors of production have become commonplace with the success of China
 But also we've started to have debates about how the role of the private sector should move away from just being a profit motive and really be more engaged in the delivery of social programs
 Of course, left-leaning policies have also tended to blur the lines between government, NGOs and private sector
Two very good examples of this are the 19th-century United States, when the infrastructure rollout was really about public-private partnerships
 More recently, of course, the advent of the Internet has also proven to the world that public and private can work together for the betterment of society
My fundamental message to you is this: We cannot continue to try and solve the world economic growth challenges by being dogmatic and being unnecessarily ideological
 In order to create sustainable, long-term economic growth and solve the challenges and social ills that continue to plague the world today, we're going to have to be more broad-minded about what might work
 What do you say to those who react that way?
 There's a lot of work going on around happiness and other metrics being used for measuring people's success and improvements in living standards
 And so I think that we should be open to what could deliver improvements in people's living standards and continue to reduce poverty around the world
 Do you see that happening?
 Well, I think that I'm more optimistic about human ability and ingenuity
 I think if we start to constrain ourselves using the finite, scarce and depleting resources that we know today, we could get quite negative and quite concerned about the way the world is
However, we've seen the Club of Rome, we've seen previous claims that the world would be running out of resources, and it's not to argue that those things are not valid
 And so in that sense, I'm much more optimistic about what humans can do
 The thing that strikes me about your proposals for rehabilitating growth and taking a different direction is that you're kind of suggesting to fix capitalism with more capitalism -- with putting a price tag on good behavior as incentive or developing a bigger role for business in social issues
 Is that what you're suggesting?
 I think it is absolutely the case that traditional models of economic growth are not working the way we would like them to
 And I think it's no accident that today the largest economy in the world, the United States, has democracy, liberal democracy, as it's core political stance and it has free market capitalism -- to the extent that it is free -- free market capitalism as its economic stance
 The second largest economy is China
 It has deprioritized democracy and it has state capitalism, which is a completely different model
 These two countries, completely different political models and completely different economic models, and yet they have the same income inequality number measured as a Gini coefficient
 One last question
 The COP21 is going on in Paris
 If you could send a tweet to all the heads of state and heads of delegations there, what would you say?
 Again, I would be very much about being open-minded
 As you're aware, the issues around the environmental concerns have been on the agenda many times now -- in Copenhagen, '72 in Stockholm -- and we keep revisiting these issues partly because there is not a fundamental agreement, in fact there's a schism between what the developed countries believe and want and what emerging market countries want
 Emerging market countries need to continue to create economic growth so that we don't have political uncertainty in the those countries
 Developed countries recognize that they have a real, important responsibility not only just to manage their CO2 emissions and some of the degradation that they're contributing to the world, but also as trendsetters in R&D
 And so they have to come to the table as well
 But in essence, it cannot be a situation where we start ascribing policies to the emerging markets without developed countries themselves also taking quite a swipe at what they're doing both in demand and supply in developed markets
Hello
 My name is Matthew Williams, and I am a champion
 I have won medals in three different sports and national games in Canada, competed at the international level in basketball and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage
I train five days a week for basketball and speed skating, work with top quality coaches and mental performance consultants to be at my best in my sport
 Does that change the way you think of me and my accomplishments?
The world does not see all people like me as champions
 Not long ago, people like me were shunned and hidden away
 There has been lots of change since Special Olympics began in 1968, but in too many cases, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to the wider population
 People use the r-word in front of me, and they think it doesn't matter
I don't want you to think I'm here because I'm a charity case
 I am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectual disabilities, or, too often, how they don't see them at all
Did you know the World Games happened this year? I was one of over 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who competed in LA
 Did you even know that happened?
What do you think of when you see someone like me? I am here today to challenge you to look at us as equals
Special Olympics transforms the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities and the perceptions of everyone watching
 For those of you who aren't familiar, Special Olympics is for athletes with intellectual disabilities
 Special Olympics is separate from the Paralympics and Olympics
 We offer high-quality, year round sports programs for people with intellectual disabilities that changes lives and perceptions
 This movement has changed my life and those of so many others
 And it has changed the way the world sees people with intellectual disabilities
 Growing up, I played hockey until I was 12 years old
 The older I got, the more I felt it was harder to keep up with everyone else, and I was angry and frustrated
 For a while, I did not play any sports, didn't have many friends and felt left out and sad
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden away from society
 No one thought they could participate in sports, let alone be a valued member of society
 In the 1960s, Dr
 Using rigorous scientific research, Dr
Lots of people doubted that people with intellectual disabilities could benefit from fitness programs and sports competition opportunities
 But pioneers like Dr
Before I joined Special Olympics, I was nervous because I was young, shy, not confident and didn't have many friends
I am one of more than four and a half million athletes around the globe, and I've heard so many similar stories
 Being Special Olympics athletes restores our pride and dignity
Special Olympics also addresses critical health needs
 Special Olympics keeps us healthy by getting us active and participating in sport
 Also, our coaches teach us about nutrition and health
 Special Olympics also provides free health screening for athletes who have difficulty communicating with their doctor or accessing health care
 The day before our game, the Nigerian basketball team went to the World Games Healthy Athlete screening, where seven of 10 members were given hearing aids for free and got to hear clearly for the first time
The change in them was amazing
 They were more excited, happy and confident, because their coach could vocally communicate with them
 And they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the basketball, the sounds of the whistle and the cheering fans in the stands -- sounds that we take for granted
 Special Olympics is transforming more than just the athlete in their sport
 This year, research findings showed that nearly half of the adults in the US don't know a single person with an intellectual disability, and the 44 percent of Americans who don't have personal contact with intellectual disabilities are significantly less accepting and positive
Then there's the r-word, proving that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to far too many people
 People use it as a casual term or an insult
 It was tweeted more than nine million times last year, and it is deeply hurtful to me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the planet
 As my fellow athlete and global messenger John Franklin Stephens wrote in an open letter to a political pundit who used the r-word as an insult, "Come join us someday at Special Olympics
 See if you walk away with your heart unchanged
"
This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games, people lined up for hours to get into the final night of powerlifting competition
 So it was standing room only when my teammate Jackie Barrett, the Newfoundland Moose, deadlifted 655 pounds and lifted 611 pounds in the squat --
setting huge new records for Special Olympics
 Jackie is a record holder among all powerlifters in Newfoundland -- not just Special Olympics, all powerlifters
Fifty years ago, few imagined individuals with intellectual disabilities could do anything like that
 Far from being hidden away, we were cheered and celebrated
 Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities deserve respect and inclusion
The world is a different place because of Special Olympics, but there is still farther to go
 So the next time you see someone with an intellectual disability, I hope you will see their ability
 I hope you will think about getting involved with Special Olympics
I would like to leave you with one final thought
Thank you very much
 Lassa virus is a lot like Ebola
 It can cause a severe fever and can often be fatal
 But these individuals, they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities, and by doing so, protect us all
But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them on one of my first visits out there many years ago was that they start each morning -- these challenging, extraordinary days on the front lines -- by singing
 They gather together, and they show their joy
 They show their spirit
 And over the years, from year after year as I've visited them and they've visited me, I get to gather with them and I sing and we write and we love it, because it reminds us that we're not just there to pursue science together; we're bonded through a shared humanity
 And that changed a great deal in March of 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea
 And it was frightening, frightening for us all
 We had actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than thought, and we thought it could one day come to Kenema
And so members of my team immediately went out and joined Dr
 Humarr Khan and his team there, and we set up diagnostics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the border and into Sierra Leone
 We'd already set up this kind of capacity for Lassa virus, we knew how to do it, the team is outstanding
 We just had to give them the tools and place to survey for Ebola
And unfortunately, that day came
 On May 23, 2014, a woman checked into the maternity ward at the hospital, and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identified the first confirmed case of Ebola in Sierra Leone
 This was an exceptional work that was done
 They were able to diagnose the case immediately, to safely treat the patient and to begin to do contact tracing to follow what was going on
 It could've stopped something
 But by the time that day came, the outbreak had already been breeding for months
 With hundreds of cases, it had already eclipsed all previous outbreaks
 And it came into Sierra Leone not as that singular case, but as a tidal wave
We had to work with the international community, with the Ministry of Health, with Kenema, to begin to deal with the cases, as the next week brought 31, then 92, then 147 cases -- all coming to Kenema, one of the only places in Sierra Leone that could deal with this
And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could, trying to help the individuals, trying to get attention, but we also did one other simple thing
 From that specimen that we take from a patient's blood to detect Ebola, we can discard it, obviously
 The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it, so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean, and that's what we did
 We sent it to Boston, where my team works
 This is the blueprint -- the genome of a virus is the blueprint
 We all have one
 It says everything that makes up us, and it tells us so much information
The results of this kind of work are simple and they're powerful
 We could actually take these 99 different viruses, look at them and compare them, and we could see, actually, compared to three genomes that had been previously published from Guinea, we could show that the outbreak emerged in Guinea months before, once into the human population, and from there had been transmitting from human to human
 Now, that's incredibly important when you're trying to figure out how to intervene, but the important thing is contact tracing
 We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans, it was mutating
 And so global health experts would need to respond, would have to develop, to recalibrate everything that they were doing
But the way that science works, the position I was in at that point is, I had the data, and I could have worked in a silo for many, many months, analyzed the data carefully, slowly, submitted the paper for publication, gone through a few back-and-forths, and then finally when the paper came out, might release that data
 That's the way the status quo works
Well, that was not going to work at this point, right? We had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help, lots of help
 So the first thing we did is, as soon as the sequences came off the machines, we published it to the web
" And help came
Before we knew it, we were being contacted from people all over, surprised to see the data out there and released
 Some of the greatest viral trackers in the world were suddenly part of our community
 We were working together in this virtual way, sharing, regular calls, communications, trying to follow the virus minute by minute, to see ways that we could stop it
 Everybody, particularly when the outbreak started to expand globally, was reaching out to learn, to participate, to engage
 Everybody wants to play a part
 The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing, and the Internet connects us all
 And could you imagine that instead of being frightened of each other, that we all just said, "Let's do this
 Let's work together, and let's make this happen
"
But the problem is that the data that all of us are using, Googling on the web, is just too limited to do what we need to do
 And so many opportunities get missed when that happens
 So in the early part of the epidemic from Kenema, we'd had 106 clinical records from patients, and we once again made that publicly available to the world
 And in our own lab, we could show that you could take those 106 records, we could train computers to predict the prognosis for Ebola patients to near 100 percent accuracy
 And we made an app that could release that, to make that available to health-care workers in the field
But 106 is just not enough to make it powerful, to validate it
 So we were waiting for more data to release that
 and the data has still not come
 We are still waiting, tweaking away, in silos rather than working together
 And this just -- we can't accept that
 Right? You, all of you, cannot accept that
 It's our lives on the line
 And in fact, actually, many lives were lost, many health-care workers, including beloved colleagues of mine, five colleagues: Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Dr
 Humarr Khan, Alice Kovoma and Mohamed Fullah
See, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, it's fueled by mistrust and distraction and division
 When we build barriers amongst ourselves and we fight amongst ourselves, the virus thrives
 But unlike all threats to humanity, Ebola is one where we're actually all the same
 We're all in this fight together
 Ebola on one person's doorstep could soon be on ours
 And so in this place with the same vulnerabilities, the same strengths, the same fears, the same hopes, I hope that we work together with joy
" That was really profound for us, because without knowing it, we'd always felt that in order to honor the individuals in Kenema where we worked, we had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together
 And we have to do that
 We all have to demand that of ourselves and others -- to be open to each other when an outbreak happens, to fight in this fight together
 Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola, it will not be the last, and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait, like Lassa virus and others
 And the next time this happens, it could happen in a city of millions, it could start there
 It could be something that's transmitted through the air
 And I know that that is frightening, I understand that, but I know also, and this experience shows us, that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing, to win this and have the upper hand over viruses
 But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy
So for Dr
 Khan and for all of those who sacrificed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always, let us be in this fight with them always
 And let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus, but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity
Thank you
When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath, and when my mind wandered, to bring it back
Sounded simple enough
 Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter
 I'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work
 Actually, it was exhausting
So why is it so hard to pay attention? Well, studies show that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something -- like maybe this talk -- at some point, about half of us will drift off into a daydream, or have this urge to check our Twitter feed
So what's going on here? It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic nervous systems known to man
This reward-based learning process is called positive and negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this
 We see some food that looks good, our brain says, "Calories! 
 Survival!" We eat the food, we taste it -- it tastes good
 And especially with sugar, our bodies send a signal to our brain that says, "Remember what you're eating and where you found it
" We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time
 See food, eat food, feel good, repeat
 Trigger, behavior, reward
 You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?" We thank our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad, we feel better
Same process, just a different trigger
 Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach, this emotional signal -- feeling sad -- triggers that urge to eat
" So we start smoking
 The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident
 See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good
 Repeat
 Trigger, behavior, reward
 And each time we do this, we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit
 So later, feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet
 Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world
So back to my breath
 but added a twist? What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening in our momentary experience?
I'll give you an example
 In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking
 Now, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force themselves to quit smoking
 And the majority of them had tried this before and failed -- on average, six times
Now, with mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious
 In fact, we even told them to smoke
 What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious about what it's like when you do
"
And what did they notice? Well here's an example from one of our smokers
 She said, "Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!" Now, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program
 What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit
Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom
 She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones, and the spell of smoking was broken
Now, the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective, it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke
 We call this cognitive control
 We're using cognition to control our behavior
 Unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful
Now, we can all relate to this in our own experience
 We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know it's not going to be helpful
 We just can't help ourselves
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits, which is why this disenchantment is so important
 Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them at a deeper level -- to know it in our bones so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior
 We're just less interested in doing it in the first place
This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking
 But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones
The paradox here is that mindfulness is just about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds from moment to moment
What does curiosity feel like? It feels good
 And what happens when we get curious? We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations -- oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness -- and that these body sensations come and go
 We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point
Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior
 But in one study, we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking
 So it actually works
And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play
 Now, one current hypothesis is that a region of this network, called the posterior cingulate cortex, is activated not necessarily by craving itself but when we get caught up in it, when we get sucked in, and it takes us for a ride
In contrast, when we let go -- step out of the process just by being curiously aware of what's happening -- this same brain region quiets down
Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and, ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors
Now, remember that bit about context-dependent memory? We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most
 So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises
 or step out of it
Thank you
 Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca, had been captured and killed
 Pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich, and tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain and was bringing new waves of Spaniards, hungry for gold and glory
 They would go into towns and ask the Inca, "Where's another civilization we can conquer? Where's more gold?"
 In fact, there is a city called Paititi -- El Dorado in Spanish -- made entirely of gold
"
 And years passed
 I'm working on my PhD at SMU, trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential, when I remember this legend, and I began asking that question
 Could the boiling river exist?
I asked colleagues from universities, the government, oil, gas and mining companies, and the answer was a unanimous no
 And this makes sense
 You need a powerful heat source to produce such a large geothermal manifestation
 And as you can see from the red dots here, which are volcanoes, we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon, nor in most of Peru
 So it follows: We should not expect to see a boiling river
Telling this same story at a family dinner, my aunt tells me, "But no, Andrés, I've been there
 I've swum in that river
"
Then my uncle jumps in
 You see, you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain, and it's protected by a powerful shaman
 Your aunt, she's friends with his wife
You know, despite all my scientific skepticism, I found myself hiking into the jungle, guided by my aunt, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center, and well, honestly, mentally preparing myself to behold the legendary "warm stream of the Amazon
"
 I heard something, a low surge that got louder and louder as we came closer
 It sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing, and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor, coming up through the trees
 And then, I saw this
I immediately grabbed for my thermometer, and the average temperatures in the river were 86 degrees C
 This is not quite the 100-degree C boiling but definitely close enough
 The river flowed hot and fast
 I followed it upriver and was led by, actually, the shaman's apprentice to the most sacred site on the river
 And this is what's bizarre -- It starts off as a cold stream
 And here we find a hot spring, mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws and thus bringing their legends to life
The next morning, I woke up and --
I asked for tea
 To my surprise, the water was clean and had a pleasant taste, which is a little weird for geothermal systems
What was amazing is that the locals had always known about this place, and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it
 It was just part of their everyday life
 They drink its water
I met the shaman, and he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle
 He asked for my intentions and listened carefully
 Then, to my tremendous relief -- I was freaking out, to be honest with you -- a smile began to snake across his face, and he just laughed
I had received the shaman's blessing to study the river, on the condition that after I take the water samples and analyze them in my lab, wherever I was in the world, that I pour the waters back into the ground so that, as the shaman said, the waters could find their way back home
I've been back every year since that first visit in 2011, and the fieldwork has been exhilarating, demanding and at times dangerous
 One story was even featured in National Geographic Magazine
 I was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper in sandals and board shorts, in between an 80 degree C river and a hot spring that, well, looked like this, close to boiling
 And on top of that, it was Amazon rain forest
 Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing
 The temperature differential made it all white
 It was a whiteout
Now, after years of work, I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication
 And I'd like to share, today, with all of you here, on the TED stage, for the first time, some of these discoveries
Well, first off, it's not a legend
 Surprise!
When I first started the research, the satellite imagery was too low-resolution to be meaningful
 There were just no good maps
 Thanks to the support of the Google Earth team, I now have this
 Not only that, the indigenous name of the river, Shanay-timpishka, "boiled with the heat of the sun," indicating that I'm not the first to wonder why the river boils, and showing that humanity has always sought to explain the world around us
So why does the river boil?
It actually took me three years to get that footage
 As we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries, so, too, the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults
 Where these arteries come to the surface, these earth arteries, we'll get geothermal manifestations: fumaroles, hot springs and in our case, the boiling river
What's truly incredible, though, is the scale of this place
 Next time you cross the road, think about this
 It flows hot for 6
24 kilometers
 Truly impressive
 There are thermal pools larger than this TED stage, and that waterfall that you see there is six meters tall -- and all with near-boiling water
We mapped the temperatures along the river, and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork
 And the results were just awesome
 Sorry -- the geoscientist in me coming out
 And it showed this amazing trend
 You see, the river starts off cold
 It then heats up, cools back down, heats up, cools back down, heats up again, and then has this beautiful decay curve until it smashes into this cold river
Now, I understand not all of you are geothermal scientists, so to put it in more everyday terms: Everyone loves coffee
 Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C, an extra-hot one, well, 60
 So, put in coffee shop terms, the boiling river plots like this
 There you have your hot coffee
 Here you have your extra-hot coffee, and you can see that there's a bit point there where the river is still hotter than even the extra-hot coffee
 And these are average water temperatures
 We took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures
But there's a magic number here that's not being shown, and that number is 47 degrees C, because that's where things start to hurt, and I know this from very personal experience
 Above that temperature, you don't want to get in that water
 You need to be careful
 It can be deadly
I've seen all sorts of animals fall in, and what's shocking to me, is the process is pretty much the same
 The stream is carrying them
 They're trying to swim out, but their meat is cooking on the bone because it's so hot
 So they're losing power, losing power, until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths and they cook from the inside out
A bit sadistic, aren't we? Jeez
 What's, again, amazing are these temperatures
 They're similar to things that I've seen on volcanoes all over the world and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone
 the data is showing that the boiling river exists independent of volcanism
 It's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin, and again, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center
 It's unique
 It's special on a global scale
 So, still -- how does it work? Where do we get this heat? There's still more research to be done to better constrain the problem and better understand the system, but from what the data is telling us now, it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system
 The waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes, then seeping down deep into the earth and coming out to form the boiling river after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient, all due to this unique geologic setting
Now, we found that in and around the river -- this is working with colleagues from National Geographic, Dr
 Jon Eisen from UC Davis -- we genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms living in and around the river, and have found new lifeforms, unique species living in the boiling river
But again, despite all of these studies, all of these discoveries and the legends, a question remains: What is the significance of the boiling river? What is the significance of this stationary cloud that always hovers over this patch of jungle? And what is the significance of a detail in a childhood legend?
To the shaman and his community, it's a sacred site
 To me, as a geoscientist, it's a unique geothermal phenomenon
 But to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers, it's just another resource to exploit
 And to the Peruvian government, it's just another stretch of unprotected land ready for development
My goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land understands the boiling river's uniqueness and significance
 Because that's the question, one of significance
 And the thing there is, we define significance
 We have that power
 We are the ones who draw that line between the sacred and the trivial
 And in this age, where everything seems mapped, measured and studied, in this age of information, I remind you all that discoveries are not just made in the black void of the unknown but in the white noise of overwhelming data
 We live in an incredible world
 So go out
 Be curious
 Because we do live in a world where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle, where rivers do boil and where legends do come to life
Thank you very much
Code is the next universal language
 In the seventies, it was punk music that drove the whole generation
 In the eighties, it was probably money
 But for my generation of people, software is the interface to our imagination and our world
 And that means that we need a radically, radically more diverse set of people to build those products, to not see computers as mechanical and lonely and boring and magic, to see them as things that they can tinker and turn around and twist, and so forth
My personal journey into the world of programming and technology started at the tender age of 14
 I had this mad teenage crush on an older man, and the older man in question just happened to be the then Vice President of the United States, Mr
 And I did what every single teenage girl would want to do
 I wanted to somehow express all of this love, so I built him a website, it's over here
 And in 2001, there was no Tumblr, there was no Facebook, there was no Pinterest
 So I needed to learn to code in order to express all of this longing and loving
 It started as a means of self-expression
 Just like when I was smaller, I would use crayons and legos
 And when I was older, I would use guitar lessons and theater plays
 And I started to be one of those people who felt that computers are boring and technical and lonely
Here's what I think today
 Little girls don't know that they are not supposed to like computers
 Little girls are amazing
 It's the parents who do
 That it's almost as far removed from everyday life as, say, nuclear physics
 There's a lot of syntax and controls and data structures and algorithms and practices, protocols and paradigms in programming
 And we as a community, we've made computers smaller and smaller
 We've built layers and layers of abstraction on top of each other between the man and the machine to the point that we no longer have any idea how computers work or how to talk to them
 And we do teach our kids how the human body works, we teach them how the combustion engine functions and we even tell them that if you want to really be an astronaut you can become one
 But when the kid comes to us and asks, "So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?" Or, "How does the computer know what happens when I press 'play,' how does it know which video to show?" Or, "Linda, is Internet a place?" We adults, we grow oddly silent
 "It's magic," some of us say
 "It's too complicated," the others say
Well, it's neither
 It's not magic and it's not complicated
 It all just happened really, really, really fast
 Computer scientists built these amazing, beautiful machines, but they made them very, very foreign to us, and also the language we speak to the computers so that we don't know how to speak to the computers anymore without our fancy user interfaces
And that's why no one recognized that when I was conjugating French irregular verbs, I was actually practicing my pattern recognition skills
 And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest to find an exact language between English and mathematics found its home inside of a computer
 I was a programmer, but no one knew it
The kids of today, they tap, swipe and pinch their way through the world
 But unless we give them tools to build with computers, we are raising only consumers instead of creators
This whole quest led me to this little girl
 Her name is Ruby, she is six years old
 She is completely fearless, imaginative and a little bit bossy
 And every time I would run into a problem in trying to teach myself programming like, "What is object-oriented design or what is garbage collection?", I would try to imagine how a six-year-old little girl would explain the problem
And I wrote a book about her and I illustrated it and the things Ruby taught me go like this
 Ruby taught me that you're not supposed to be afraid of the bugs under your bed
 And even the biggest of the problems are a group of tiny problems stuck together
 She has friends like the Snow Leopard, who is beautiful but doesn't want to play with the other kids
 And she has friends like the green robots that are really friendly but super messy
 And she has friends like Linux the penguin who's really ruthlessly efficient, but somewhat hard to understand
In Ruby's world, you learn technology through play
 And, for instance, computers are really good at repeating stuff, so the way Ruby would teach loops goes like this
 This is Ruby's favorite dance move, it goes, "Clap, clap, stomp, stomp clap, clap and jump
" And you learn counter loops by repeating that four times
 And you learn while loops by repeating that sequence while I'm standing on one leg
 And you learn until loops by repeating that sequence until mom gets really mad
  And most of all, you learn that there are no ready answers
When coming up with the curriculum for Ruby's world, I needed to really ask the kids how they see the world and what kind of questions they have and I would organize play testing sessions
 I would start by showing the kids these four pictures
 I would show them a picture of a car, a grocery store, a dog and a toilet
 And I would ask, "Which one of these do you think is a computer?" And the kids would be very conservative and go, "None of these is a computer
 I know what a computer is: it's that glowing box in front of which mom or dad spends way too much time
" But then we would talk and we would discover that actually, a car is a computer, it has a navigation system inside of it
 And a dog -- a dog might not be a computer, but it has a collar and the collar might have a computer inside of it
 And grocery stores, they have so many different kinds of computers, like the cashier system and the burglar alarms
 And kids, you know what? In Japan, toilets are computers and there's even hackers who hack them
And we go further and I give them these little stickers with an on/off button on them
 And I tell the kids, "Today you have this magic ability to make anything in this room into a computer
" And again, the kids go, "Sounds really hard, I don't know the right answer for this
" But I tell them, "Don't worry, your parents don't know the right answer, either
 They've just started to hear about this thing called The Internet of Things
 But you kids, you are going to be the ones who are really going to live up in a world where everything is a computer
"
And then I had this little girl who came to me and took a bicycle lamp and she said, "This bicycle lamp, if it were a computer, it would change colors
" And I said, "That's a really good idea, what else could it do?" And she thinks and she thinks, and she goes, "If this bicycle lamp were a computer, we could go on a biking trip with my father and we would sleep in a tent and this biking lamp could also be a movie projector
" And that's the moment I'm looking for, the moment when the kid realizes that the world is definitely not ready yet, that a really awesome way of making the world more ready is by building technology and that each one of us can be a part of that change
Final story, we also built a computer
 And after we've assembled our computer together, we also design an application for it
 And my favorite story is this little boy, he's six years old and his favorite thing in the world is to be an astronaut
 And the boy, he has these huge headphones on and he's completely immersed in his tiny paper computer because you see, he's built his own intergalactic planetary navigation application
 And his father, the lone astronaut in the Martian orbit, is on the other side of the room and the boy's important mission is to bring the father safely back to earth
 And these kids are going to have a profoundly different view of the world and the way we build it with technology
Finally, the more approachable, the more inclusive, and the more diverse we make the world of technology, the more colorful and better the world will look like
 So, imagine with me, for a moment, a world where the stories we tell about how things get made don't only include the twentysomething-year-old Silicon Valley boys, but also Kenyan schoolgirls and Norwegian librarians
 Imagine a world where the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow, who live in a permanent reality of 1s and 0s, they grow up to be very optimistic and brave about technology
 They embrace the powers and the opportunities and the limitations of the world
 A world of technology that is wonderful, whimsical and a tiny bit weird
When I was a girl, I wanted to be a storyteller
 I loved make-believe worlds and my favorite thing to do was to wake up in the mornings in Moominvalley
 In the afternoons, I would roam around the Tatooines
 And programming turned out to be the perfect profession for me
 I still create worlds
 Instead of stories, I do them with code
Thank you
 Bali -- island of gods
 A green paradise
 Or 
 a paradise lost
 Bali: island of garbage
 That's about a 14-story building
 And when it comes to plastic bags, less than five percent gets recycled
 It changed ours, too, when we learned about it, when we learned that almost all plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains and then in our rivers and then in our ocean
 And we have had some significant successes
 We are sisters, and we go to the best school on earth: Green School, Bali
 Green School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo, but also in the way that it teaches
 We are taught to become leaders of today, something a normal textbook cannot match
 One day we had a lesson in class where we learned about significant people, like Nelson Mandela, Lady Diana and Mahatma Gandhi
 Sitting on the sofa that night, we brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing Bali
 And one thing that stood out to us the most was the plastic garbage
 But that is a huge problem
 So we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids: plastic bags
 And the idea was born
 We started researching, and let's just say, the more we learned, there was nothing good about plastic bags
 And you know what? We don't even need them
 We were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags in many other places, from Hawaii to Rwanda and to severals cities like Oakland and Dublin
 And so the idea turned into the launch of "Bye Bye Plastic Bags
 you cannot do it all by yourself
 You need a big team of like-minded kids, and so we formed the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew
 And together with them, we started a multi-layered approach, based on an on- and off-line signature petition, educational and inspirational presentations at schools and we raise general awareness at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups
 And last but not least, we distribute alternative bags, bags like net bags, recycled newspaper bags or 100 percent organic material bags, all made by local initiatives on the island
 We run a pilot village, home of 800 families
 The village mayor was our first friend and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped
 We focused on making the customers aware, because that's where the change needs to happen
 The village is already two-thirds along the way of becoming plastic bag free
 So we thought, "Hmm 
 They can't ignore us, right?"
 Right!
We got stuck -- till we learned lesson number two: think outside the box
 But how do we get into the airport? And here comes lesson number three: persistence
 Off we headed to the airport
 We got past the janitor
 And then it was his boss's boss, and then the assistant office manager, and then the office manager, and then 
 we got shuffled down two levels and thought, well, here comes the janitor again
And after several days knocking on doors and just being kids on a mission, we finally got to the commercial manager of Bali airports
 And we gave him the "Bali of plastic bags" speech, and being a very nice man, he said, [imitating the man's voice] "I cannot believe what I'm about say, but I'm going to give authorization to collect signatures behind customs and immigrations
"
 In our first hour and a half there, we got almost 1,000 signatures
 you need champions at all levels of society, from students to commercial managers to famous people
 Ban Ki Moon taught us that Secretary-Generals of the United Nations don't sign petitions --
even if kids ask nicely
 But he promised to spread the word, and now we work closely with the United Nations
 Jane Goodall taught us the power of a people's network
 She started with just one Roots & Shoots group and now she has 4,000 groups around the world
 We are one of them
 She's a real inspiration
If you're a fellow Rotarian, nice to meet you
 We're Interactors, the youngest department of Rotary International
 But we have also learned much about patience,
 how to deal with frustrations,
 friendship,
 we learned more about the Balinese and their culture
 It's not always easy
 Sometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk
 But last year, we did exactly that
 We went to India to give a talk, and our parents took us to visit the former private house of Mahatma Gandhi
 We learned about the power of hunger strikes he did to reach his goals
 Yes, by the end of the tour, when we met our parents again, we both made a decision and said, "We're going on a hunger strike!"
 And you can probably imagine their faces
 It took a lot of convincing, and not only to our parents but to our friends and to our teachers as well
 Isabel and I were serious about doing this
 So we met with a nutritionist, and we came up with a compromise of not eating from sunrise to sunset every day until the governor of Bali would agree to meet with us to talk about how to stop plastic bags on Bali
 Our "mogak makan," as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia, started
 We used social media to support our goal and already on day two, police started to come to our home and school
 Twenty-four hours later, we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor
 And there he was --
waiting for us to meet and speak, being all supportive and thankful for our willingness to care for the beauty and the environment of Bali
He signed a promise to help the people of Bali say no to plastic bags
 And we are now friends, and on a regular basis, we remind him and his team of the promises he has made
 And indeed, recently he stated and committed that Bali will be plastic bag free by 2018
 Also, at the International Airport of Bali, one of our supporters is planning to start a plastic bag-free policy by 2016
 Stop handing out free plastic bags and bring in your own reusable bag is our next message to change that mindset of the public
 Our short-term campaign, "One Island / One Voice," is all about this
 We check and recognize the shops and restaurants that have declared themselves a plastic bag-free zone, and we put this sticker at their entrance and publish their names on social media and some important magazines on Bali
 And conversely, that highlights those who do not have the sticker
 So, why are we actually telling you all of this? Well, partly, it is because we are proud of the results that, together with our team, we have been able to reach
 But also because along the way, we have learned that kids can do things
 We can make things happen
 Isabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old when we started this
 All we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags from wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home
 Kids have a boundless energy and a motivation to be the change the world needs
 So to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world: go for it! Make that difference
 We're not telling you it's going to be easy
 We're telling you it's going to be worth it
 We still have a lot of work to do, but know that we still not stop until the first question asked when arriving at the Bali airports will be
 "Welcome to Bali, do you have nay plastic bags to declare?"
Om shanti shanti shanti om
Thank you
This is Pleurobot
 Pleurobot is a robot that we designed to closely mimic a salamander species called Pleurodeles waltl
 Pleurobot can walk, as you can see here, and as you'll see later, it can also swim
So you might ask, why did we design this robot? And in fact, this robot has been designed as a scientific tool for neuroscience
 Indeed, we designed it together with neurobiologists to understand how animals move, and especially how the spinal cord controls locomotion
 But the more I work in biorobotics, the more I'm really impressed by animal locomotion
 If you think of a dolphin swimming or a cat running or jumping around, or even us as humans, when you go jogging or play tennis, we do amazing things
 And in fact, our nervous system solves a very, very complex control problem
 It has to coordinate more or less 200 muscles perfectly, because if the coordination is bad, we fall over or we do bad locomotion
 The first component is just the body, and in fact we should never underestimate to what extent the biomechanics already simplify locomotion in animals
 Then you have the spinal cord, and in the spinal cord you find reflexes, multiple reflexes that create a sensorimotor coordination loop between neural activity in the spinal cord and mechanical activity
 A third component are central pattern generators
 These are very interesting circuits in the spinal cord of vertebrate animals that can generate, by themselves, very coordinated rhythmic patterns of activity while receiving only very simple input signals
 And these input signals coming from descending modulation from higher parts of the brain, like the motor cortex, the cerebellum, the basal ganglia, will all modulate activity of the spinal cord while we do locomotion
 But what's interesting is to what extent just a low-level component, the spinal cord, together with the body, already solve a big part of the locomotion problem
 You probably know it by the fact that you can cut the head off a chicken, it can still run for a while, showing that just the lower part, spinal cord and body, already solve a big part of locomotion
Now, understanding how this works is very complex, because first of all, recording activity in the spinal cord is very difficult
 It's much easier to implant electrodes in the motor cortex than in the spinal cord, because it's protected by the vertebrae
 Especially in humans, very hard to do
 A second difficulty is that locomotion is really due to a very complex and very dynamic interaction between these four components
 So it's very hard to find out what's the role of each over time
 This is where biorobots like Pleurobot and mathematical models can really help
So what's biorobotics? Biorobotics is a very active field of research in robotics where people want to take inspiration from animals to make robots to go outdoors, like service robots or search and rescue robots or field robots
 And the big goal here is to take inspiration from animals to make robots that can handle complex terrain -- stairs, mountains, forests, places where robots still have difficulties and where animals can do a much better job
 The robot can be a wonderful scientific tool as well
 There are some very nice projects where robots are used, like a scientific tool for neuroscience, for biomechanics or for hydrodynamics
 So what we do in my lab is to collaborate with neurobiologists like Jean-Marie Cabelguen, a neurobiologist in Bordeaux in France, and we want to make spinal cord models and validate them on robots
 And here we want to start simple
So it's good to start with simple animals like lampreys, which are very primitive fish, and then gradually go toward more complex locomotion, like in salamanders, but also in cats and in humans, in mammals
 And in fact, for me, Pleurobot is a kind of dream becoming true
 Like, more or less 20 years ago I was already working on a computer making simulations of lamprey and salamander locomotion during my PhD
 But I always knew that my simulations were just approximations
 Like, simulating the physics in water or with mud or with complex ground, it's very hard to simulate that properly on a computer
 Why not have a real robot and real physics? So among all these animals, one of my favorites is the salamander
 You might ask why, and it's because as an amphibian, it's a really key animal from an evolutionary point of view
So the salamander swims by doing what's called an anguilliform swimming gait, so they propagate a nice traveling wave of muscle activity from head to tail
 And if you place the salamander on the ground, it switches to what's called a walking trot gait
 In this case, you have nice periodic activation of the limbs which are very nicely coordinated with this standing wave undulation of the body, and that's exactly the gait that you are seeing here on Pleurobot
 Now, one thing which is very surprising and fascinating in fact is the fact that all this can be generated just by the spinal cord and the body
 So if you take a decerebrated salamander -- it's not so nice but you remove the head -- and if you electrically stimulate the spinal cord, at low level of stimulation this will induce a walking-like gait
 If you stimulate a bit more, the gait accelerates
 And at some point, there's a threshold, and automatically, the animal switches to swimming
 This is amazing
 Just changing the global drive, as if you are pressing the gas pedal of descending modulation to your spinal cord, makes a complete switch between two very different gaits
 And in fact, the same has been observed in cats
 If you stimulate the spinal cord of a cat, you can switch between walk, trot and gallop
 And thanks to that, you really have an amazing machine to record all the bone motion in great detail
 That's what we did
 So we basically figured out which bones are important for us and collected their motion in 3D
 And what we did is collect a whole database of motions, both on ground and in water, to really collect a whole database of motor behaviors that a real animal can do
 And then our job as roboticists was to replicate that in our robot
 So we did a whole optimization process to find out the right structure, where to place the motors, how to connect them together, to be able to replay these motions as well as possible
 And this is how Pleurobot came to life
 So what you see here is almost a direct comparison between the walking of the real animal and the Pleurobot
 You can see that we have almost a one-to-one exact replay of the walking gait
 If you go backwards and slowly, you see it even better
 But even better, we can do swimming
 So for that we have a dry suit that we put all over the robot --
and then we can go in water and start replaying the swimming gaits
 And here, we were very happy, because this is difficult to do
 The physics of interaction are complex
 Our robot is much bigger than a small animal, so we had to do what's called dynamic scaling of the frequencies to make sure we had the same interaction physics
 So let's go to the spinal cord
 So here what we did with Jean-Marie Cabelguen is model the spinal cord circuits
 And what's interesting is that the salamander has kept a very primitive circuit, which is very similar to the one we find in the lamprey, this primitive eel-like fish, and it looks like during evolution, new neural oscillators have been added to control the limbs, to do the leg locomotion
 And we tested that on board of a robot
 And the only thing we do is send to the robot through a remote control the two descending signals it normally should receive from the upper part of the brain
 And what's interesting is, by playing with these signals, we can completely control speed, heading and type of gait
 And finally, we can also do turning very nicely by just stimulating more one side of the spinal cord than the other
 And I think it's really beautiful how nature has distributed control to really give a lot of responsibility to the spinal cord so that the upper part of the brain doesn't need to worry about every muscle
 It just has to worry about this high-level modulation, and it's really the job of the spinal cord to coordinate all the muscles
So now let's go to cat locomotion and the importance of biomechanics
 So this is another project where we studied cat biomechanics, and we wanted to see how much the morphology helps locomotion
 And we found three important criteria in the properties, basically, of the limbs
 The first one is that a cat limb more or less looks like a pantograph-like structure
 So a pantograph is a mechanical structure which keeps the upper segment and the lower segments always parallel
 So a simple geometrical system that kind of coordinates a bit the internal movement of the segments
 A second property of cat limbs is that they are very lightweight
 Most of the muscles are in the trunk, which is a good idea, because then the limbs have low inertia and can be moved very rapidly
 The last final important property is this very elastic behavior of the cat limb, so to handle impacts and forces
 And this is how we designed Cheetah-Cub
So let's invite Cheetah-Cub onstage
 So this is Peter Eckert, who does his PhD on this robot, and as you see, it's a cute little robot
 It looks a bit like a toy, but it was really used as a scientific tool to investigate these properties of the legs of the cat
 So you see, it's very compliant, very lightweight, and also very elastic, so you can easily press it down and it will not break
 It will just jump, in fact
 And this very elastic property is also very important
 And you also see a bit these properties of these three segments of the leg as pantograph
 And that's interesting, because it means that just the mechanics already stabilized this quite rapid gait, and that really good mechanics already basically simplify locomotion
 To the extent that we can even disturb a bit locomotion, as you will see in the next video, where we can for instance do some exercise where we have the robot go down a step, and the robot will not fall over, which was a surprise for us
 This is a small perturbation
 I was expecting the robot to immediately fall over, because there are no sensors, no fast feedback loop
 But no, just the mechanics stabilized the gait, and the robot doesn't fall over
 Obviously, if you make the step bigger, and if you have obstacles, you need the full control loops and reflexes and everything
 But what's important here is that just for small perturbation, the mechanics are right
 And I think this is a very important message from biomechanics and robotics to neuroscience, saying don't underestimate to what extent the body already helps locomotion
Now, how does this relate to human locomotion? Clearly, human locomotion is more complex than cat and salamander locomotion, but at the same time, the nervous system of humans is very similar to that of other vertebrates
 That's why, if there's a lesion of the spinal cord, this has dramatic effects
 The person can become paraplegic or tetraplegic
 This is because the brain loses this communication with the spinal cord
 Especially, it loses this descending modulation to initiate and modulate locomotion
 So a big goal of neuroprosthetics is to be able to reactivate that communication using electrical or chemical stimulations
 And there are several teams in the world that do exactly that, especially at EPFL
 My colleagues Grégoire Courtine and Silvestro Micera, with whom I collaborate
But to do this properly, it's very important to understand how the spinal cord works, how it interacts with the body, and how the brain communicates with the spinal cord
 This is where the robots and models that I've presented today will hopefully play a key role towards these very important goals
Thank you
 Auke, I've seen in your lab other robots that do things like swim in pollution and measure the pollution while they swim
 But for this one, you mentioned in your talk, like a side project, search and rescue, and it does have a camera on its nose
 Absolutely
 And the big dream is to, if you have a difficult situation like a collapsed building or a building that is flooded, and this is very dangerous for a rescue team or even rescue dogs, why not send in a robot that can crawl around, swim, walk, with a camera onboard to do inspection and identify survivors and possibly create a communication link with the survivor
 Of course, assuming the survivors don't get scared by the shape of this
 Yeah, we should probably change the appearance quite a bit, because here I guess a survivor might die of a heart attack just of being worried that this would feed on you
 But by changing the appearance and it making it more robust, I'm sure we can make a good tool out of it
 Thank you very much
 Thank you and your team
It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005
 I was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor
 I really, really loved my job, but I was having one of those days where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged
So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office
 Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years, so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights
I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck
 I had been investigating a number of issues at the intersection of science and civil liberties -- super interesting
 But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way, in a way that could really make a difference
So Chris cut right to the chase, and he says, "Well, of all the issues you've been looking at, what are the top five?"
"Well, there's genetic discrimination, and reproductive technologies, and biobanking, and 
 oh, there's this really cool issue, functional MRI and using it for lie detection, and 
 oh, and of course, there's gene patents
"
"Gene patents?"
"Yes, you know, patents on human genes
"
"
I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles
 And 20 minutes later, he came bursting in my office
 "Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?"
Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer, but he knew almost nothing about patent law and certainly nothing about genetics
First, we needed to understand exactly what was patented when someone patented a gene
 Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims, but the most controversial of these are to so-called "isolated DNA" -- namely, a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell
Gene patent proponents say, "See? We didn't patent the gene in your body, we patented an isolated gene
" And that's true, but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated
 And the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated, but on every possible version of that gene
So what does that mean?
That means that you can't give your gene to your doctor and ask him or her to look at it, say, to see if it has any mutations, without permission of the patent holder
 It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone from using that gene in research or clinical testing
 Allowing patent holders, often private companies, to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients
 The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition developed a test to diagnose the syndrome
 But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it
 So another lab tried to offer the test, but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab for patent infringement
 So as a result, for 2 years, no test was available
 During that time, Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT
 But was there a way we could challenge them?
Turns out that the Supreme Court has made clear through a long line of cases, that certain things are not patent eligible
 You can't patent products of nature -- the air, the water, minerals, elements of the periodic table
It seemed to us that DNA, the most fundamental structure of life, that codes for the production of all of our proteins, is both a product of nature and a law of nature, regardless of whether it's in our bodies or sitting in the bottom of a test tube
 Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy, and, at least in theory, as a matter of law
 There were literally thousands of patents on human genes
 The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo, the biotech industry had grown up around this practice, and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced year after year in Congress, and had gone absolutely nowhere
 So the bottom line: courts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents
 So we set out to build our case
Now, patent cases tend to be: Company A sues Company B over some really narrow, obscure technical issue
 We weren't really interested in that kind of case, and we thought this case was much bigger than that
 This was about scientific freedom, medical progress, the rights of patients
 So we decided we were going to develop a case that was not like your typical patent case -- more like a civil rights case
We set out to identify a gene-patent holder that was vigorously enforcing its patents and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could tell the court about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation
 Myriad held patents on two genes, the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes
 Myriad had used its patents to maintain a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States
 It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop
 It charged a lot of money for its test -- over 3,000 dollars
 It had stopped sharing its clinical data with the international scientific community
 And perhaps worst of all, for a period of several years, Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations that had been identified by a team of researchers in France
It has been estimated that during that period, for several years, as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing received the wrong answer -- a negative test result that should have been positive
 Kathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40 and she was tested by Myriad
 The test was negative
 That meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family, and that other members of her family didn't need to be tested
 But two years later, Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer
 Had Eileen received the proper result, Kathleen would have then been tested, and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented
Once we settled on Myriad, we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts that could illuminate these problems
 We ended up with 20 highly committed plaintiffs: genetic counselors, geneticists who had received cease and desist letters, advocacy organizations, four major scientific organizations that collectively represented more than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals, and individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test, or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not, as a result of the patents
We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts, trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts simply yet accurately
So isolating DNA -- it's like extracting gold from a mountain or taking it out of a stream bed
 You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold, but you can't patent the gold itself
 It might've taken a lot of hard work and effort to dig the gold out of the mountain; you still can't patent it, it's still gold
 And the gold, once it's extracted, can clearly be used for all sorts of things that it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain; you can make jewelry out of it for example -- still can't patent the gold, it's still gold
So now it's 2009, and we're ready to file our case
 In March 2010, Judge Sweet issued his opinion -- 152 pages -- and a complete victory for our side
In reading the opinion, we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case
 I mean, our brief -- it was pretty good, but not this good
 How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue in such a short time? We just could not comprehend how this had happened
 So it turned out, Judge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time, was not just a lawyer -- he was a scientist
 He was not just a scientist -- he had a PhD in molecular biology
What an incredible stroke of luck!
Myriad then appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
 And here things got really interesting
First, in a pivotal moment of this case, the US government switched sides
So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad's side
 But now in direct opposition to its own patent office, the US government files a brief that states that is has reconsidered this issue in light of the district court's opinion, and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit hears all patent cases, and it has a reputation for being very, very pro-patent
 And we did
 Sort of
 But the two judges who ruled against us, did so for completely different reasons
 The first one, Judge Lourie, made up his own novel, biological theory -- totally wrong
He decided Myriad had created a new chemical -- made absolutely no sense
 Myriad didn't even argue this, so it came out of the blue
 The other, Judge Moore, said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature
 But she's like, "I don't want to shake up the biotech industry
" The third, Judge Bryson, agreed with us
So now we sought review by the Supreme Court
 And when you petition the Supreme Court, you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer
 Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph, like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses, "wherein this" and "therefore that
" We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever
 Four words: Are human genes patentable?
Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words, I said, "Well, I don't know
 I think you have to say, 'Is isolated DNA patentable?'"
"Nope
 I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had when you brought this issue to me seven years ago
 The day of the oral argument arrives, and it was really, really exciting -- long line of people outside, people had been standing in line since 2:30 in the morning to try to get into the courthouse
 Two breast cancer organizations, Breast Cancer Action and FORCE, had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps
Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project, including the co-discoverer of DNA himself, James Watson, who had submitted a brief to the court, where he referred to gene patenting as "lunacy
"
The diversity of the communities represented in this room and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality spoke volumes to what was at stake
The argument itself was riveting
 Chris argued brilliantly
 But for me, the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple with isolated DNA, through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges, very much the same way as our legal team had done for the past seven years
 Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon
 And in one of my absolutely favorite moments, Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be "just nature sitting there
"
We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day, but I could never have anticipated the outcome: nine to zero
"A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature, and not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated
 And furthermore, Myriad did not create anything
Within 24 hours of the decision, five labs had announced that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes
 Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad's
 Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test than the one Myriad was offering
But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad
 It ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes in the United States
 It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation
 And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen have access to the tests that they need
A few weeks after the court issued its decision, I received a small package in the mail
 It was from Bob Cook-Deegan, a professor at Duke University and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit when we started to consider whether to bring this case
 I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal
We took a big risk in taking this case
 Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk was knowing that we were doing the right thing
 A little luck certainly helped, but it was the communities that we bridged, the alliances that we created, that made pigs fly
Thank you
I'm a marine biologist and an explorer-photographer with National Geographic, but I want to share a secret
 This image is totally incorrect, totally incorrect
 I see a couple of people crying in the back that I've blown their idea of mermaids
 All right, the mermaid is indeed real, but anyone who's gone on a dive will know that the ocean looks more like this
 It's because the ocean is this massive filter, and as soon as you start going underwater, you're going to lose your colors, and it's going to get dark and blue very quickly
But we're humans -- we're terrestrial mammals
 And we've got trichromatic vision, so we see in red, green and blue, and we're just complete color addicts
 We love eye-popping color, and we try to bring this eye-popping color underwater with us
So there's been a long and sordid history of bringing color underwater, and it starts 88 years ago with Bill Longley and Charles Martin, who were trying to take the first underwater color photograph
 And they're in there with old-school scuba suits, where you're pumping air down to them, and they've got a pontoon of high-explosive magnesium powder, and the poor people at the surface are not sure when they're going to pull the string when they've got their frame in focus, and -- boom! -- a pound of high explosives would go off so they could put a little bit of light underwater and get an image like this beautiful hogfish
 I mean, it's a gorgeous image, but this is not real
 They're creating an artificial environment so we can satisfy our own addiction to color
And looking at it the other way, what we've been finding is that instead of bringing color underwater with us, that we've been looking at the blue ocean, and it's a crucible of blue, and these animals living there for millions of years have been evolving all sorts of ways to take in that blue light and give off other colors
 And here's just a little sample of what this secret world looks like
 It's like an underwater light show
Again, what we're seeing here is blue light hitting this image
 These animals are absorbing the blue light and immediately transforming this light
So if you think about it, the ocean is 71 percent of the planet, and blue light can extend down to almost a 1,000 meters
 As we go down underwater, after about 10 meters, all the red is gone
 So if you see anything under 10 meters that's red, it's an animal transforming and creating its own red
 This is the largest single monochromatic blue environment on our planet
 And in this coral, it could be making up to 14 percent of its body mass -- could be this fluorescent protein
 So you wouldn't be making, like, 14 percent muscle and not using it, so it's likely doing something that has a functional role
So, how do I study this? In order to study biofluorescence, we swim at night
 And when I started out, I was just using these blue duct-tape filters over my strobe, so I could make sure I'm actually seeing the light that's being transformed by the animals
 We're making an exhibit for the Museum of Natural History, and we're trying to show off how great the fluorescent corals are on the reef, and something happened that just blew me away: this
 In the middle of our corals, is this green fluorescent fish
 It's the first time we've ever seen a green fluorescent fish or any vertebrate for that matter
 And we're rubbing our eyes, checking the filters, thinking that somebody's maybe playing a joke on us with the camera, but the eel was real
It was the first green fluorescent eel that we found, and this just changed my trajectory completely
 So I had to put down my corals and team up with a fish scientist, John Sparks, and begin a search around the world to see how prevalent this phenomenon is
 And fish are much more interesting than corals, because they have really advanced vision, and some of the fish even have, the way that I was photographing it, they have lenses in their eyes that would magnify the fluorescence
 So I wanted to seek this out further
So we designed a new set of gear and we're scouring the reefs around the world, looking for fluorescent life
 And it's a bit like "E
 phone home
" We're out there swimming with this blue light, and we're looking for a response, for animals to be absorbing the light and transferring this back to us
 And eventually, we found our photobombing Kaupichphys eel
9 percent of their time hidden under a rock
 But these eels do come out to mate under full-moon nights, and that full-moon night translates underwater to blue
 Perhaps they're using this as a way to see each other, quickly find each other, mate, go back into their hole for the next long stint of time
 But then we started to find other fluorescent marine life, like this green fluorescent bream, with its, like, racing stripes along its head and its nape, and it's almost camouflaged and fluorescing at the same intensity as the fluorescent coral there
After this fish, we were introduced to this red fluorescent scorpionfish cloaked and hidden on this rock
 The only time we've ever seen this, it's either on red fluorescent algae or red fluorescent coral
 But if you look at them under fluorescent light, you see lots of patterns, you can really see the differences among them
 And in total -- we just reported this last year -- we found over 200 species of biofluorescent fish
 He really captures this entrepreneuring, creative spirit in biology
 He would design his own gear, make his own cameras, and he was fascinated with the seahorse, Hippocampus erectus, and he filmed for the first time the seahorse giving birth
 So this is the male seahorse
 The males give birth, just phenomenal creatures
 So he stayed awake for days
 He even put this electrical visor on his head that would shock him, so he could capture this moment
 Now, I wish I could have shown Painlevé the moment where we found biofluorescent seahorses in the exact same species that he was studying
They're the most cryptic fish
 They would blend right into the algae, which would also fluoresce red, but they've got great vision, and they go through this long mating ritual, and perhaps they're using it in that effect
But things got pretty edgy when we found green fluorescence in the stingray, because stingrays are in the Elasmobranch class, which includes 
 sharks
 Somebody's got to go down and check to see if the sharks are fluorescent
 And there I am
And I was like, "Maybe I should go back to corals
"
It turns out that these sharks are not fluorescent
 And then we found it
 In a deep, dark canyon off the coast of California, we found the first biofluorescent swellshark, right underneath all the surfers
 They're just about a meter long
 It's called a swellshark
 And they call them a swellshark because if they're threatened, they can gulp down water and blow up like an inner tube, about twice their size, and wedge themselves under a rock, so they don't get eaten by a predator
 And here is our first footage of these biofluorescent swellsharks
 Just magnificent -- I mean, they're showing these distinct patterns, and there are areas that are fluorescent and areas that are not fluorescent, but they've also got these twinkling spots on them that are much brighter than other parts of the shark
But this is all beautiful to see
 But what does it mean to the shark? Can they see this? And we looked in the literature, and nothing was known about this shark's vision
 So I took this shark to eye specialist Ellis Loew at Cornell University, and we found out that this shark sees discretely and acutely in the blue-green interface, probably about 100 times better than we can see in the dark, but they only see blue-green
 So what it's doing is taking this blue world and it's absorbing the blue, creating green
But our last find came really just a few miles from where we are now, in the Solomon Islands
 Swimming at night, I encountered the first biofluorescent sea turtle
 And it makes me think about how much more there is to learn
 And here in the Solomon Islands, there's only a few thousand breeding females of this species left, and this is one of the hotspots for them
 So it shows us how much we need to really protect these animals while they're still here, and understand them
In thinking about biofluorescence, I wanted to know, how deep does it go? Does this go all the way to the bottom of the ocean? So we started using submarines, and we equipped them with special blue lights on the front here
 And we dropped down, and we noticed one important thing -- that as we get down to 1,000 meters, it drops off
 There's no biofluorescent marine life down there, below 1,000 meters -- almost nothing, it's just darkness
As I try to get deeper, this is slapping on a one-person submarine suit -- some people call this my "Jacques Cousteau meets Woody Allen" moment
But as we explore down here, I was thinking about: How do we interact with life delicately? Because we're entering a new age of exploration, where we have to take great care, and we have to set examples how we explore
 So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood at Harvard University, and we've been designing squishy underwater robot fingers, so we can delicately interact with the marine life down there
 You don't want to just go and crush them with a big claw
Back to the powerful applied applications
 Here, you're looking at a living brain that's using the DNA of fluorescent marine creatures, this one from jellyfish and corals, to illuminate the living brain and see its connections
 It's funny that we're using RGB just to kind of satisfy our own human intuition, so we can see our brains better
 And even more mind-blowing, is my close colleague Vincent Pieribone at Yale, who has actually designed and engineered a fluorescent protein that responds to voltage
 So he could see when a single neuron fires
 You're essentially looking at a portal into consciousness that was designed by marine creatures
So this brings me all back to perspective and relationship
 And it's my hope that with illuminated minds, we could ponder the overarching interconnectedness of all life, and fathom how much more lies in store if we keep our oceans healthy
Thank you
 In the West, we make a colossal mistake taking it for granted
 We mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy
 It doesn't
 Indeed, democracy is receding in our neck of the woods, here in Europe
Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- in the Eurogroup as its Finance Minister, I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process -- our elections -- could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece
 At that moment, I felt that there could be no greater vindication of Lee Kuan Yew, or the Chinese Communist Party, indeed of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything
Tonight, here, I want to present to you an economic case for an authentic democracy
 And without democracy, our societies will be nastier, our future bleak and our great, new technologies wasted
Speaking of waste, allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak
 I call it the twin peaks paradox
 But few people discern its twin
Now let me give you two numbers
 Over the last three months, in the United States, in Britain and in the Eurozone, we have invested, collectively, 3
4 trillion dollars on all the wealth-producing goods -- things like industrial plants, machinery, office blocks, schools, roads, railways, machinery, and so on and so forth
 $3
4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5
So a mountain of debt and a mountain of idle cash form twin peaks, failing to cancel each other out through the normal operation of the markets
The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds in America, in Japan and in Europe out of work
 And consequently, low aggregate demand, which in a never-ending cycle, reinforces the pessimism of the investors, who, fearing low demand, reproduce it by not investing -- exactly like Oedipus' father, who, terrified by the prophecy of the oracle that his son would grow up to kill him, unwittingly engineered the conditions that insured that Oedipus, his son, would kill him
This is my quarrel with capitalism
 Its gross wastefulness, all this idle cash, should be energized to improve lives, to develop human talents, and indeed to finance all these technologies, green technologies, which are absolutely essential for saving planet Earth
Am I right in believing that democracy might be the answer? I believe so, but before we move on, what do we mean by democracy? Aristotle defined democracy as the constitution in which the free and the poor, being in the majority, control government
Now, of course Athenian democracy excluded too many
 Women, migrants and, of course, the slaves
 But it would be a mistake to dismiss the significance of ancient Athenian democracy on the basis of whom it excluded
What was more pertinent, and continues to be so about ancient Athenian democracy, was the inclusion of the working poor, who not only acquired the right to free speech, but more importantly, crucially, they acquired the rights to political judgments that were afforded equal weight in the decision-making concerning matters of state
 Now, of course, Athenian democracy didn't last long
 Like a candle that burns brightly, it burned out quickly
 And indeed, our liberal democracies today do not have their roots in ancient Athens
 They have their roots in the Magna Carta, in the 1688 Glorious Revolution, indeed in the American constitution
 Whereas Athenian democracy was focusing on the masterless citizen and empowering the working poor, our liberal democracies are founded on the Magna Carta tradition, which was, after all, a charter for masters
 And indeed, liberal democracy only surfaced when it was possible to separate fully the political sphere from the economic sphere, so as to confine the democratic process fully in the political sphere, leaving the economic sphere -- the corporate world, if you want -- as a democracy-free zone
Now, in our democracies today, this separation of the economic from the political sphere, the moment it started happening, it gave rise to an inexorable, epic struggle between the two, with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere, eating into its power
Similarly, the economic sphere has been colonizing and cannibalizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself, causing economic crisis
 Corporate power is increasing, political goods are devaluing, inequality is rising, aggregate demand is falling and CEOs of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their corporations
So the more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy, the taller the twin peaks and the greater the waste of human resources and humanity's wealth
Clearly, if this is right, we must reunite the political and economic spheres and better do it with a demos being in control, like in ancient Athens except without the slaves or the exclusion of women and migrants
Now, this is not an original idea
 The Marxist left had that idea 100 years ago and it didn't go very well, did it?
The lesson that we learned from the Soviet debacle is that only by a miracle will the working poor be reempowered, as they were in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste
But there is a solution: eliminate the working poor
 Capitalism's doing it by replacing low-wage workers with automata, androids, robots
 The problem is that as long as the economic and the political spheres are separate, automation makes the twin peaks taller, the waste loftier and the social conflicts deeper, including -- soon, I believe -- in places like China
So we need to reconfigure, we need to reunite the economic and the political spheres, but we'd better do it by democratizing the reunified sphere, lest we end up with a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy that makes The Matrix, the movie, look like a documentary
So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological innovations it is spawning
 The more interesting question is whether capitalism will be succeeded by something resembling a Matrix dystopia or something much closer to a Star Trek-like society, where machines serve the humans and the humans expend their energies exploring the universe and indulging in long debates about the meaning of life in some ancient, Athenian-like, high tech agora
I think we can afford to be optimistic
 But what would it take, what would it look like to have this Star Trek-like utopia, instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?
In practical terms, allow me to share just briefly, a couple of examples
At the level of the enterprise, imagine a capital market, where you earn capital as you work, and where your capital follows you from one job to another, from one company to another, and the company -- whichever one you happen to work at at that time -- is solely owned by those who happen to work in it at that moment
 Then all income stems from capital, from profits, and the very concept of wage labor becomes obsolete
 No more separation between those who own but do not work in the company and those who work but do not own the company; no more tug-of-war between capital and labor; no great gap between investment and saving; indeed, no towering twin peaks
At the level of the global political economy, imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a free-floating exchange rate, with a universal, global, digital currency, one that is issued by the International Monetary Fund, the G-20, on behalf of all humanity
 And imagine further that all international trade is denominated in this currency -- let's call it "the cosmos," in units of cosmos -- with every government agreeing to be paying into a common fund a sum of cosmos units proportional to the country's trade deficit, or indeed to a country's trade surplus
This is not a new idea
 The problem is that back then, they didn't have the technology to implement it
 Now we do, especially in the context of a reunified political-economic sphere
Will such a world dawn? Or shall we descend into a Matrix-like dystopia? The answer lies in the political choice that we shall be making collectively
 It is our choice, and we'd better make it democratically
Thank you
 Yanis 
 It was you who described yourself in your bios as a libertarian Marxist
 What is the relevance of Marx's analysis today?
 Well, if there was any relevance in what I just said, then Marx is relevant
 Because the whole point of reunifying the political and economic is -- if we don't do it, then technological innovation is going to create such a massive fall in aggregate demand,
what Larry Summers refers to as secular stagnation
 With this crisis migrating from one part of the world, as it is now, it will destabilize not only our democracies, but even the emerging world that is not that keen on liberal democracy
 So if this analysis holds water, then Marx is absolutely relevant
 But so is Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and so is Keynes, so that's why I'm totally confused
 Indeed, and possibly we are too, now
 If you are not confused, you are not thinking, OK?
 That was Einstein, actually --
 During your talk you mentioned Singapore and China, and last night at the speaker dinner, you expressed a pretty strong opinion about how the West looks at China
 Would you like to share that?
 Well, there's a great degree of hypocrisy
 It's because we have confined, as I was saying in my talk, democracy to the political sphere, while leaving the one sphere where all the action is -- the economic sphere -- a completely democracy-free zone
In a sense, if I am allowed to be provocative, China today is closer to Britain in the 19th century
 Because remember, we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically
 And to be castigating China for doing that which the West did in the 19th century, smacks of hypocrisy
 I am sure that many people here are wondering about your experience as the Finance Minister of Greece earlier this year
 I knew this was coming
 Yes
 Six months after, how do you look back at the first half of the year?
 Extremely exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had an opportunity to reboot the Eurozone
 Not just Greece, the Eurozone
 To move away from the complacency and the constant denial that there was a massive -- and there is a massive architectural fault line going through the Eurozone, which is threatening, massively, the whole of the European Union process
We had an opportunity on the basis of the Greek program -- which by the way, was the first program to manifest that denial -- to put it right
 And, unfortunately, the powers in the Eurozone, in the Eurogroup, chose to maintain denial
 This is the experience of the Soviet Union
 What kind of change are you foreseeing?
 Did you make any mistakes when you were Finance Minister?
 Every day
No, but seriously
 If there's any Minister of Finance, or of anything else for that matter, who tells you after six months in a job, especially in such a stressful situation, that they have made no mistake, they're dangerous people
The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of a loan agreement in the end of February
 I was imagining that there was a genuine interest on the side of the creditors to find common ground
 They were simply interested in crushing our government, just because they did not want to have to deal with the architectural fault lines that were running through the Eurozone
 And because they didn't want to admit that for five years they were implementing a catastrophic program in Greece
 We lost one-third of our nominal GDP
 This is worse than the Great Depression
 Despite all this, and despite the aggressiveness of the discussion, you seem to be remaining quite pro-European
 Absolutely
 Look, my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone comes from a person who lives and breathes Europe
 And that will be catastrophic not just for Europe but for the whole global economy
We are probably the largest economy in the world
 Yanis, thank you for coming to TED
 Thank you
 And you've been shuffling down long corridors, past statues, frescoes, lots and lots of stuff
 You're heading towards the Sistine Chapel
 You're at the threshold of the Sistine Chapel
So what are you expecting? Soaring domes? Choirs of angels? We don't really have any of that there
Well, curtains up on the Sistine Chapel
 And I mean literally, you're surrounded by painted curtains, the original decoration of this chapel
 Churches used tapestries not just to keep out cold during long masses, but as a way to represent the great theater of life
Now, this building started out as a space for a small group of wealthy, educated Christian priests
 They prayed there
 They elected their pope there
 Five hundred years ago, it was the ultimate ecclesiastical man cave
 So, you may ask, how can it be that today it attracts and delights five million people a year, from all different backgrounds? Because in that compressed space, there was a creative explosion, ignited by the electric excitement of new geopolitical frontiers, which set on fire the ancient missionary tradition of the Church and produced one of the greatest works of art in history
Now, this development took place as a great evolution, moving from the beginning of a few elite, and eventually able to speak to audiences of people that come from all over the world
 This evolution took place in three stages, each one linked to a historical circumstance
 It reflected the rather parochial perspective
The original decoration of this church reflected a smaller world
 There were busy scenes that told the stories of the lives of Jesus and Moses, reflecting the development of the Jewish and Christian people
 The man who commissioned this, Pope Sixtus IV, assembled a dream team of Florentine art, including men like Sandro Botticelli and the man who would become Michelangelo's future painting teacher, Ghirlandaio
 These men, they blanketed the walls with a frieze of pure color, and in these stories you'll notice familiar landscapes, the artists using Roman monuments or a Tuscan landscape to render a faraway story, something much more familiar
 But in 1492, the New World was discovered, horizons were expanding, and this little 133 by 46-foot microcosm had to expand as well
 And it did, thanks to a creative genius, a visionary and an awesome story
Now, the creative genius was Michelangelo Buonarroti, 33 years old when he was tapped to decorate 12,000 square feet of ceiling, and the deck was stacked against him -- he had trained in painting but had left to pursue sculpture
 There were angry patrons in Florence because he had left a stack of incomplete commissions, lured to Rome by the prospect of a great sculptural project, and that project had fallen through
 And he had been left with a commission to paint 12 apostles against a decorative background in the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which would look like every other ceiling in Italy
 In an age when a man dared to sail across the Atlantic Ocean, Michelangelo dared to chart new artistic waters
 He, too, would tell a story -- no Apostles -- but a story of great beginnings, the story of Genesis
Not really an easy sell, stories on a ceiling
 How would you be able to read a busy scene from 62 feet below? The painting technique that had been handed on for 200 years in Florentine studios was not equipped for this kind of a narrative
But Michelangelo wasn't really a painter, and so he played to his strengths
 Instead of being accustomed to filling space with busyness, he took a hammer and chisel and hacked away at a piece of marble to reveal the figure within
 Michelangelo was an essentialist; he would tell his story in massive, dynamic bodies
This plan was embraced by the larger-than-life Pope Julius II, a man who was unafraid of Michelangelo's brazen genius
 He left us the Raphael Rooms, the Sistine Chapel
 He left St
 Peter's Basilica as well as an extraordinary collection of Greco-Roman sculptures -- decidedly un-Christian works that would become the seedbed of the world's first modern museum, the Vatican Museums
 The encounter between these two giants, Michelangelo and Julius II, that's what gave us the Sistine Chapel
 Michelangelo was so committed to this project, that he succeeded in getting the job done in three and a half years, using a skeleton crew and spending most of the time, hours on end, reaching up above his head to paint the stories on the ceiling
So let's look at this ceiling and see storytelling gone global
 No more familiar artistic references to the world around you
 There's just space and structure and energy; a monumental painted framework which opens onto nine panels, more driven by sculptural form than painterly color
 And we stand in the far end by the entrance, far from the altar and from the gated enclosure intended for the clergy and we peer into the distance, looking for a beginning
 And whether in scientific inquiry or in biblical tradition, we think in terms of a primal spark
 Michelangelo gave us an initial energy when he gave us the separation of light and dark, a churning figure blurry in the distance, compressed into a tight space
 The next figure looms larger, and you see a figure hurtling from one side to the next
 He leaves in his wake the sun, the moon, vegetation
 Michelangelo didn't focus on the stuff that was being created, unlike all the other artists
 He focused on the act of creation
And then the movement stops, like a caesura in poetry and the creator hovers
"
So now the scene is set, and you get to the culmination of creation, which is man
 Adam leaps to the eye, a light figure against a dark background
 But looking closer, that leg is pretty languid on the ground, the arm is heavy on the knee
 Adam lacks that interior spark that will impel him to greatness
 That spark is about to be conferred by the creator in that finger, which is one millimeter from the hand of Adam
 It puts us at the edge of our seats, because we're one moment from that contact, through which that man will discover his purpose, leap up and take his place at the pinnacle of creation
 Who is in that other arm? Eve, first woman
 She's part of the plan
 She's always been in his mind
 Look at her, so intimate with God that her hand curls around his arm
 And for me, an American art historian from the 21st century, this was the moment that the painting spoke to me
 And the fact is, that when you see them together in the Garden of Eden, they fall together and together their proud posture turns into folded shame
 You are exactly at the point where you and I can go no further into the church
 The gated enclosure keeps us out of the inner sanctum, and we are cast out much like Adam and Eve
 The remaining scenes in the ceiling, they mirror the crowded chaos of the world around us
 You have Noah and his Ark and the flood
 He's making a sacrifice and a covenant with God
 Maybe he's the savior
 Oh, but no, Noah is the one who grew grapes, invented wine, got drunk and passed out naked in his barn
 And so, compared with Adam, you might think Michelangelo is making fun of us
But he's about to dispel the gloom by using those bright colors right underneath Noah: emerald, topaz, scarlet on the prophet Zechariah
 Zechariah foresees a light coming from the east, and we are turned at this juncture to a new destination, with sibyls and prophets who will lead us on a parade
And now we're at the keystone of the ceiling, the culmination of the whole thing, with a figure that looks like he's about to fall out of his space into our space, encroaching our space
This is the most important juncture
 Past meets present
 This figure, Jonah, who spent three days in the belly of the whale, for the Christians, is the symbol of the renewal of humanity through Jesus' sacrifice, but for the multitudes of visitors to that museum from all faiths who visit there every day, he is the moment the distant past encounters and meets immediate reality
All of this brings us to the yawning archway of the altar wall, where we see Michelangelo's Last Judgment, painted in 1534 after the world had changed again
 The Reformation had splintered the Church, the Ottoman Empire had made Islam a household word and Magellan had found a route into the Pacific Ocean
 How is a 59-year-old artist who has never been any further than Venice going to speak to this new world? Michelangelo chose to paint destiny, that universal desire, common to all of us, to leave a legacy of excellence
 Told in terms of the Christian vision of the Last Judgment, the end of the world, Michelangelo gave you a series of figures who are wearing these strikingly beautiful bodies
 They have no more covers, no more portraits except for a couple
 It's a composition only out of bodies, 391, no two alike, unique like each and every one of us
 They start in the lower corner, breaking away from the ground, struggling and trying to rise
 Those who have risen reach back to help others, and in one amazing vignette, you have a black man and a white man pulled up together in an incredible vision of human unity in this new world
 The lion's share of the space goes to the winner's circle
 There you find men and women completely nude like athletes
 So you have men and women flexing and posing in this extraordinary spotlight
 Presiding over this assembly is Jesus, first a suffering man on the cross, now a glorious ruler in Heaven
 And as Michelangelo proved in his painting, hardship, setbacks and obstacles, they don't limit excellence, they forge it
Now, this does lead us to one odd thing
 This is the Pope's private chapel, and the best way you can describe that is indeed a stew of nudes
 But Michelangelo was trying to use only the best artistic language, the most universal artistic language he could think of: that of the human body
 And so instead of the way of showing virtue such as fortitude or self-mastery, he borrowed from Julius II's wonderful collection of sculptures in order to show inner strength as external power
Now, one contemporary did write that the chapel was too beautiful to not cause controversy
 And so it did
 Michelangelo soon found that thanks to the printing press, complaints about the nudity spread all over the place, and soon his masterpiece of human drama was labeled pornography, at which point he added two more portraits, one of the man who criticized him, a papal courtier, and the other one of himself as a dried up husk, no athlete, in the hands of a long-suffering martyr
 The year he died he saw several of these figures covered over, a triumph for trivial distractions over his great exhortation to glory
And so now we stand in the here and now
 We are caught in that space between beginnings and endings, in the great, huge totality of the human experience
 The Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror
 Who am I in this picture? Am I one of the crowd? Am I the drunk guy? Am I the athlete? And as we leave this haven of uplifting beauty, we are inspired to ask ourselves life's biggest questions: Who am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?
Thank you
 Elizabeth Lev, thank you
 But actually the story is bigger
 It's not just touching up and covering up some of the figures
 The effect of the Last Judgment was enormous
 Did you notice you have pornography in the Pope's chapel?" And so after complaints and insistence of trying to get this work destroyed, it was finally the year that Michelangelo died that the Church finally found a compromise, a way to save the painting, and that was in putting up these extra 30 covers, and that happens to be the origin of fig-leafing
 That's where it all came about, and it came about from a church that was trying to save a work of art, not indeed deface or destroyed it
 This, what you just gave us, is not the classic tour that people get today when they go to the Sistine Chapel
 I don't know, is that an ad?
 The experience of art today is encountering problems
 Right
 I agree
 I think it's really nice to be able to pause and look
 It's a great statement about how beauty truly can speak to us all through time and through geographic space
 Liz, grazie
 Grazie a te
 Thank you
Welcome to Bayeku, a riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos -- a vivid representation of several riverine communities across Nigeria, communities whose waterways have been infested by an invasive aquatic weed; communities where economic livelihoods have been hampered: fishing, marine transportation and trading; communities where fish yields have diminished; communities where schoolchildren are unable to go to school for days, sometimes weeks, on end
 Who would have thought that this plant with round leaves, inflated stems, and showy, lavender flowers would cause such havoc in these communities
The plant is known as water hyacinth and its botanical name, Eichhornia crassipes
 Interestingly, in Nigeria, the plant is also known by other names, names associated with historical events, as well as myths
 In some places, the plant is called Babangida
 When you hear Babangida, you remember the military and military coups
 And you think: fear, restraint
 In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta, the plant is also known as Abiola
 In the southwestern part of Nigeria, the plant is known as Gbe'borun
 Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase which translates to "gossip," or "talebearer
" When you think of gossip, you think: rapid reproduction, destruction
 And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria, the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma, And when you hear that, you think of death
 It literally translates to "death to mother and child
"
I personally had my encounter with this plant in the year 2009
 It was shortly after I had relocated from the US to Nigeria
 I'd quit my job in corporate America and decided to take this big leap of faith, a leap of faith that came out of a deep sense of conviction that there was a lot of work to do in Nigeria in the area of sustainable development
And I looked to my left and saw this very arresting image
 It was an image of fishing boats that had been hemmed in by dense mats of water hyacinth
 And I was really pained by what I saw because I thought to myself, "These poor fisherfolk, how are they going to go about their daily activities with these restrictions
" And then I thought, "There's got to be a better way
" A win-win solution whereby the environment is taken care of by the weeds being cleared out of the way and then this being turned into an economic benefit for the communities whose lives are impacted the most by the infestation of the weed
 That, I would say, was my spark moment
And so I did further research to find out more about the beneficial uses of this weed
 Out of the several, one struck me the most
 It was the use of the plant for handicrafts
 And I thought, "What a great idea
" Personally, I love handicrafts, especially handicrafts that are woven around a story
 And so I thought, "This could be easily deployed within the communities without the requirement of technical skills
"
 Get out into the waterways and harvest the water hyacinth
 That way, you create access
Secondly, you dry the water hyacinth stems
And thirdly, you weave the water hyacinth into products
The third step was a challenge
 See, I'm a computer scientist by background and not someone in the creative arts
 And so I began my quest to find out how I can learn how to weave
And this quest took me to a community in Ibadan, where I lived, called Sabo
 Sabo translates to "strangers' quarters
" And the community is predominantly made up of people from the northern part of the country
 So I literally took my dried weeds in hand, there were several more of them, and went knocking from door to door to find out who could teach me how to weave these water hyacinth stems into ropes
 And I was directed to the shed of Malam Yahaya
 The problem, though, is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English and neither did I speak Hausa
 But some little kids came to the rescue and helped translate
 And that began my journey of learning how to weave and transform these dried water hyacinth stems into long ropes
With my long ropes in hand, I was now equipped to make products
 And that was the beginning of partnerships
 Working with rattan basket makers to come up with products
 So taking these weeds and actually weaving them into products that can be sold
 So we have pens, we have tableware, we have purses, we have tissue boxes
 Thereby, helping the communities to see water hyacinth in a different light
 Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable, being aesthetic, being durable, tough, resilient
 Changing names, changing livelihoods
From Gbe'borun, gossip, to Olusotan, storyteller
 And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma, which is "killer of mother and child," to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma, "provider of food for mother and child
 He said, "If you want to learn about a culture, listen to the stories
 And if you want to change a culture, change the stories
"
And so, from Makoko community, to Abobiri, to Ewoi, to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba, we have changed the story
Thank you for listening
I have a question
 You think about it for a minute, and you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like: What is a computer? What is poetry? What is creativity? But these are questions that people spend their entire lifetime trying to answer, not in a single TED Talk
 So we're going to have to try a different approach
So up here, we have two poems
 One of them is written by a human, and the other one's written by a computer
 I'm going to ask you to tell me which one's which
 Have a go:
 Little Fly / Thy summer's play, / My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away
 We can feel / Activist through your life's / morning / Pauses to see, pope I hate the / Non all the night to start a / great otherwise 
Alright, time's up
 Hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human
 OK, most of you
 Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human
 Very brave of you, because the first one was written by the human poet William Blake
 The second one was written by an algorithm that took all the language from my Facebook feed on one day and then regenerated it algorithmically, according to methods that I'll describe a little bit later on
 A lion roars and a dog barks
 It is interesting / and fascinating that a bird will fly and not / roar or bark
 Oh! kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas! / You are really beautiful! Pearls, / harmonicas, jujubes, aspirins! All / the stuff they've always talked about 
Alright, time's up
 So if you think the first poem was written by a human, put your hand up
 OK
 And if you think the second poem was written by a human, put your hand up
 We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here
 It was much harder
The answer is, the first poem was generated by an algorithm called Racter, that was created back in the 1970s, and the second poem was written by a guy called Frank O'Hara, who happens to be one of my favorite human poets
So what we've just done now is a Turing test for poetry
 The Turing test was first proposed by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950, in order to answer the question, can computers think? Alan Turing believed that if a computer was able to have a to have a text-based conversation with a human, with such proficiency such that the human couldn't tell whether they are talking to a computer or a human, then the computer can be said to have intelligence
So in 2013, my friend Benjamin Laird and I, we created a Turing test for poetry online
 It's called bot or not, and you can go and play it for yourselves
 But basically, it's the game we just played
 You're presented with a poem, you don't know whether it was written by a human or a computer and you have to guess
And what are the results? Well, Turing said that if a computer could fool a human 30 percent of the time that it was a human, then it passes the Turing test for intelligence
 We have poems on the bot or not database that have fooled 65 percent of human readers into thinking it was written by a human
 So, I think we have an answer to our question
 According to the logic of the Turing test, can a computer write poetry? Well, yes, absolutely it can
 But if you're feeling a little bit uncomfortable with this answer, that's OK
 If you're having a bunch of gut reactions to it, that's also OK because this isn't the end of the story
Let's play our third and final test
 Again, you're going to have to read and tell me which you think is human
 Reg flags the reason for pretty flags
 / And ribbons
 A wounded deer leaps highest, / I've heard the daffodil I've heard the flag to-day / I've heard the hunter tell; / 'Tis but the ecstasy of death, / And then the brake is almost done 
OK, time is up
 So hands up if you think Poem 1 was written by a human
 Hands up if you think Poem 2 was written by a human
 Whoa, that's a lot more people
 So you'd be surprised to find that Poem 1 was written by the very human poet Gertrude Stein
 And Poem 2 was generated by an algorithm called RKCP
 Now before we go on, let me describe very quickly and simply, how RKCP works
 So, you give RKCP a source text, it analyzes the source text in order to find out how it uses language, and then it regenerates language that emulates that first text
So in the poem we just saw before, Poem 2, the one that you all thought was human, it was fed a bunch of poems by a poet called Emily Dickinson it looked at the way she used language, learned the model, and then it regenerated a model according to that same structure
 But the important thing to know about RKCP is that it doesn't know the meaning of the words it's using
 The language is just raw material, it could be Chinese, it could be in Swedish, it could be the collected language from your Facebook feed for one day
 It's just raw material
 And nevertheless, it's able to create a poem that seems more human than Gertrude Stein's poem, and Gertrude Stein is a human
So what we've done here is, more or less, a reverse Turing test
 So Gertrude Stein, who's a human, is able to write a poem that fools a majority of human judges into thinking that it was written by a computer
Feeling confused? I think that's fair enough
So far we've had humans that write like humans, we have computers that write like computers, we have computers that write like humans, but we also have, perhaps most confusingly, humans that write like computers
So what do we take from all of this? Do we take that William Blake is somehow more of a human than Gertrude Stein? Or that Gertrude Stein is more of a computer than William Blake?
These are questions I've been asking myself for around two years now, and I don't have any answers
 But what I do have are a bunch of insights about our relationship with technology
So my first insight is that, for some reason, we associate poetry with being human
 So that when we ask, "Can a computer write poetry?" we're also asking, "What does it mean to be human and how do we put boundaries around this category? How do we say who or what can be part of this category?" This is an essentially philosophical question, I believe, and it can't be answered with a yes or no test, like the Turing test
 I also believe that Alan Turing understood this, and that when he devised his test back in 1950, he was doing it as a philosophical provocation
So my second insight is that, when we take the Turing test for poetry, we're not really testing the capacity of the computers because poetry-generating algorithms, they're pretty simple and have existed, more or less, since the 1950s
 Rather, it is something that's constructed with our opinions and something that changes over time
So my final insight is that the computer, more or less, works like a mirror that reflects any idea of a human that we show it
 We show it Emily Dickinson, it gives Emily Dickinson back to us
 We show it Gertrude Stein, what we get back is Gertrude Stein
 More than any other bit of technology, the computer is a mirror that reflects any idea of the human we teach it
So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing a lot about artificial intelligence recently
 And much of the conversation is, can we build it? Can we build an intelligent computer? Can we build a creative computer? What we seem to be asking over and over is can we build a human-like computer?
But what we've seen just now is that the human is not a scientific fact, that it's an ever-shifting, concatenating idea and one that changes over time
 So that when we begin to grapple with the ideas of artificial intelligence in the future, we shouldn't only be asking ourselves, "Can we build it?" But we should also be asking ourselves, "What idea of the human do we want to have reflected back to us?" This is an essentially philosophical idea, and it's one that can't be answered with software alone, but I think requires a moment of species-wide, existential reflection
Thank you
I believe that the secret to producing extremely drought-tolerant crops, which should go some way to providing food security in the world, lies in resurrection plants, pictured here, in an extremely droughted state
 You might think that these plants look dead, but they're not
 Give them water, and they will resurrect, green up, start growing, in 12 to 48 hours
Now, why would I suggest that producing drought-tolerant crops will go towards providing food security? Well, the current world population is around 7 billion
 And it's estimated that by 2050, we'll be between 9 and 10 billion people, with the bulk of this growth happening in Africa
 Given that plants are at the base of the food chain, most of that's going to have to come from plants
This is taken from a study by Dai published in 2011, where he took into consideration all the potential effects of climate change and expressed them -- amongst other things -- increased aridity due to lack of rain or infrequent rain
 The areas in red shown here, are areas that until recently have been very successfully used for agriculture, but cannot anymore because of lack of rainfall
 This is the situation that's predicted to happen in 2050
 We're going to have to think of some very smart ways of producing food
 And preferably among them, some drought-tolerant crops
The other thing to remember about Africa is that most of their agriculture is rainfed
Now, making drought-tolerant crops is not the easiest thing in the world
 And the reason for this is water
 Water is essential to life on this planet
 All life reactions happen in water
 And loss of a small amount of water results in death
 You and I are 65 percent water -- we lose one percent of that, we die
 But we can make behavioral changes to avoid that
 Plants can't
 They're stuck in the ground
Most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss
 So extreme examples of resistors can be found in succulents
 They tend to be small, very attractive, but they hold onto their water at such great cost that they grow extremely slowly
 They send down very deep roots, mine subterranean water supplies and just keep flushing it through them at all times, keeping themselves hydrated
The one on the right is called a baobab
 It's also called the upside-down tree, simply because the proportion of roots to shoots is so great that it looks like the tree has been planted upside down
 And of course the roots are required for hydration of that plant
And probably the most common strategy of avoidance is found in annuals
 Up the west coast of my country, for much of the year you don't see much vegetation growth
 But come the spring rains, you get this: flowering of the desert
The strategy in annuals, is to grow only in the rainy season
 At the end of that season they produce a seed, which is dry, eight to 10 percent water, but very much alive
 And anything that is that dry and still alive, we call desiccation-tolerant
In the desiccated state, what seeds can do is lie in extremes of environment for prolonged periods of time
It's widely believed that the evolution of desiccation-tolerant seeds allowed the colonization and the radiation of flowering plants, or angiosperms, onto land
But back to annuals as our major form of food supplies
 Wheat, rice and maize form 95 percent of our plant food supplies
 And it's been a great strategy because in a short space of time you can produce a lot of seed
 Seeds are energy-rich so there's a lot of food calories, you can store it in times of plenty for times of famine, but there's a downside
 The vegetative tissues, the roots and leaves of annuals, do not have much by way of inherent resistance, avoidance or tolerance characteristics
 They just don't need them
 They grow in the rainy season and they've got a seed to help them survive the rest of the year
And so despite concerted efforts in agriculture to make crops with improved properties of resistance, avoidance and tolerance -- particularly resistance and avoidance because we've had good models to understand how those work -- we still get images like this
 Maize crop in Africa, two weeks without rain and it's dead
 resurrection plants
 These plants can lose 95 percent of their cellular water, remain in a dry, dead-like state for months to years, and give them water, they green up and start growing again
 Like seeds, these are desiccation-tolerant
 Like seeds, these can withstand extremes of environmental conditions
 And this is a really rare phenomenon
 There are only 135 flowering plant species that can do this
I'm going to show you a video of the resurrection process of these three species in that order
 And at the bottom, there's a time axis so you can see how quickly it happens
Pretty amazing, huh?
So I've spent the last 21 years trying to understand how they do this
 How do these plants dry without dying? And I work on a variety of different resurrection plants, shown here in the hydrated and dry states, for a number of reasons
One of them is that each of these plants serves as a model for a crop that I'd like to make drought-tolerant
So on the extreme top left, for example, is a grass, it's called Eragrostis nindensis, it's got a close relative called Eragrostis tef -- a lot of you might know it as "teff" -- it's a staple food in Ethiopia, it's gluten-free, and it's something we would like to make drought-tolerant
For example we look at things like changes in the plant anatomy as they dried out and their ultrastructure
 We look at the transcriptome, which is just a term for a technology in which we look at the genes that are switched on or off, in response to drying
 Most genes will code for proteins, so we look at the proteome
 They use what I call a highly tuned chemical arsenal to protect themselves from all the stresses of their environment
 So it's important that we look at the chemical changes involved in drying
And at the last study that we do at the molecular level, we look at the lipidome -- the lipid changes in response to drying
 And that's also important because all biological membranes are made of lipids
 Take away the water, those membranes fall apart
 Lipids also act as signals to turn on genes
Then we use physiological and biochemical studies to try and understand the function of the putative protectants that we've actually discovered in our other studies
 And then use all of that to try and understand how the plant copes with its natural environment
I'm sure some of you are thinking, "By biotic application, does she mean she's going to make genetically modified crops?" And the answer to that question is: depends on your definition of genetic modification
All of the crops that we eat today, wheat, rice and maize, are highly genetically modified from their ancestors, but we don't consider them GM because they're being produced by conventional breeding
 If you mean, am I going to put resurrection plant genes into crops, your answer is yes
In the essence of time, we have tried that approach
 More appropriately, some of my collaborators at UCT, Jennifer Thomson, Suhail Rafudeen, have spearheaded that approach and I'm going to show you some data soon
But we're about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach, in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes that are already present in every crop
 They're just never turned on under extreme drought conditions
 I leave it up to you to decide whether those should be called GM or not
I'm going to now just give you some of the data from that first approach
 And in order to do that I have to explain a little bit about how genes work
 It's wound very tightly into chromosomes that are present in every cell of your body or in a plant's body
 If you unwind that DNA, you get genes
 And each gene has a promoter, which is just an on-off switch, the gene coding region, and then a terminator, which indicates that this is the end of this gene, the next gene will start
Now, promoters are not simple on-off switches
 They normally require a lot of fine-tuning, lots of things to be present and correct before that gene is switched on
 So what's typically done in biotech studies is that we use an inducible promoter, we know how to switch it on
 We couple that to genes of interest and put that into a plant and see how the plant responds
In the study that I'm going to talk to you about, my collaborators used a drought-induced promoter, which we discovered in a resurrection plant
 The nice thing about this promoter is that we do nothing
 The plant itself senses drought
 And we've used it to drive antioxidant genes from resurrection plants
 Why antioxidant genes? Well, all stresses, particularly drought stress, results in the formation of free radicals, or reactive oxygen species, which are highly damaging and can cause crop death
 What antioxidants do is stop that damage
 To the left of the arrow are plants without the genes, to the right -- plants with the antioxidant genes
 After three weeks without watering, the ones with the genes do a hell of a lot better
Now to the final approach
 My research has shown that there's considerable similarity in the mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in seeds and resurrection plants
 So I ask the question, are they using the same genes? Or slightly differently phrased, are resurrection plants using genes evolved in seed desiccation tolerance in their roots and leaves? Have they retasked these seed genes in roots and leaves of resurrection plants?
And I answer that question, as a consequence of a lot of research from my group and recent collaborations from a group of Henk Hilhorst in the Netherlands, Mel Oliver in the United States and Julia Buitink in France
 The answer is yes, that there is a core set of genes that are involved in both
 So as maize seeds dried out at the end of their period of development, they switch these genes on
 Resurrection plants switch on the same genes when they dry out
 All modern crops, therefore, have these genes in their roots and leaves, they just never switch them on
 They only switch them on in seed tissues
So what we're trying to do right now is to understand the environmental and cellular signals that switch on these genes in resurrection plants, to mimic the process in crops
And just a final thought
 What we're trying to do very rapidly is to repeat what nature did in the evolution of resurrection plants some 10 to 40 million years ago
My plants and I thank you for your attention
I wanted to be an astronaut when I was a little kid, but growing up in Canada as a young girl, that wasn't really available to me
 But as it turns out, we know a lot more about space than we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet, the very lifeblood of Mother Earth
 So I decided to do something that was even more remarkable
But what I want to teach you today is that our world is not one big solid rock
 It's a whole lot more like a sponge
 I can swim through a lot of the pores in our earth's sponge, but where I can't, other life-forms and other materials can make that journey without me
 And my voice is the one that's going to teach you about the inside of Mother Earth
There was no guidebook available to me when I decided to be the first person to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs
 In 2000, this was the largest moving object on the planet
We use a technology called rebreathers
 It's an awful lot like the same technology that is used for space walks
 This technology enables us to go deeper than we could've imagined even 10 years ago
 We use exotic gases, and we can make missions even up to 20 hours long underwater
I work with biologists
 It turns out that caves are repositories of amazing life-forms, species that we never knew existed before
 Many of these life-forms live in unusual ways
 They have no pigment and no eyes in many cases, and these animals are also extremely long-lived
 In fact, animals swimming in these caves today are identical in the fossil record that predates the extinction of the dinosaurs
 What can they teach us about evolution and survival? When we look at an animal like this remipede swimming in the jar, he has giant fangs with venom
 He can actually attack something 40 times his size and kill it
 If he were the size of a cat, he'd be the most dangerous thing on our planet
 And these animals live in remarkably beautiful places, and in some cases, caves like this, that are very young, yet the animals are ancient
 How did they get there?
I also work with physicists, and they're interested oftentimes in global climate change
 They can take rocks within the caves, and they can slice them and look at the layers within with rocks, much like the rings of a tree, and they can count back in history and learn about the climate on our planet at very different times
 The red that you see in this photograph is actually dust from the Sahara Desert
 It's rained down in this case on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas
 It soaks in through the ground and deposits itself in the rocks within these caves
 And when we look back in the layers of these rocks, we can find times when the climate was very, very dry on earth, and we can go back many hundreds of thousands of years
Paleoclimatologists are also interested in where the sea level stands were at other times on earth
 Here in Bermuda, my team and I embarked on the deepest manned dives ever conducted in the region, and we were looking for places where the sea level used to lap up against the shoreline, many hundreds of feet below current levels
I also get to work with paleontologists and archaeologists
But my very favorite project of all was over 15 years ago, when I was a part of the team that made the very first accurate, three-dimensional map of a subterranean surface
 This device that I'm driving through the cave was actually creating a three-dimensional model as we drove it
 We also used ultra low frequency radio to broadcast back to the surface our exact position within the cave
 So I swam under houses and businesses and bowling alleys and golf courses, and even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant,
Pretty remarkable, and what that taught me was that everything we do on the surface of our earth will be returned to us to drink
 Our water planet is not just rivers, lakes and oceans, but it's this vast network of groundwater that knits us all together
 It's a shared resource from which we all drink
 And when we can understand our human connections with our groundwater and all of our water resources on this planet, then we'll be working on the problem that's probably the most important issue of this century
So I never got to be that astronaut that I always wanted to be, but this mapping device, designed by Dr
 Bill Stone, will be
 It's actually morphed
 It's now a self-swimming autonomous robot, artificially intelligent, and its ultimate goal is to go to Jupiter's moon Europa and explore oceans beneath the frozen surface of that body
And that's pretty amazing
For much of the past century, architecture was under the spell of a famous doctrine
 "Form follows function" had become modernity's ambitious manifesto and detrimental straitjacket, as it liberated architecture from the decorative, but condemned it to utilitarian rigor and restrained purpose
 Of course, architecture is about function, but I want to remember a rewriting of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi, and I want to propose a completely different quality
 If form follows fiction, we could think of architecture and buildings as a space of stories -- stories of the people that live there, of the people that work in these buildings
 And we could start to imagine the experiences our buildings create
In this sense, I'm interested in fiction not as the implausible but as the real, as the reality of what architecture means for the people that live in it and with it
 Our buildings are prototypes, ideas for how the space of living or how the space of working could be different, and what a space of culture or a space of media could look like today
 Our buildings are real; they're being built
 They're an explicit engagement in physical reality and conceptual possibility
 I think of our architecture as organizational structures
 At their core is indeed structural thinking, like a system: How can we arrange things in both a functional and experiential way? How can we create structures that generate a series of relationships and narratives? And how can fictive stories of the inhabitants and users of our buildings script the architecture, while the architecture scripts those stories at the same time?
 So we could think of architecture as complex systems of relationships, both in a programmatic and functional way and in an experiential and emotive or social way
 When I first arrived in Beijing in 2002, the city planners showed us this image: a forest of several hundred skyscrapers to emerge in the central business district, except at that time, only a handful of them existed
 So we had to design in a context that we knew almost nothing about, except one thing: it would all be about verticality
Of course, the skyscraper is vertical -- it's a profoundly hierarchical structure, the top always the best, the bottom the worst, and the taller you are, the better, so it seems
 Our idea was to bring all aspects of television-making into one single structure: news, program production, broadcasting, research and training, administration -- all into a circuit of interconnected activities where people would meet in a process of exchange and collaboration
I still very much like this image
 It reminds one of biology classes, if you remember the human body with all its organs and circulatory systems, like at school
 And suddenly you think of architecture no longer as built substance, but as an organism, as a life form
 And as you start to dissect this organism, you can identify a series of primary technical clusters -- program production, broadcasting center and news
 Those are tightly intertwined with social clusters: meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas -- informal spaces for people to meet and exchange
 So the organizational structure of this building was a hybrid between the technical and the social, the human and the performative
 And of course, we used the loop of the building as a circulatory system, to thread everything together and to allow both visitors and staff to experience all these different functions in a great unity
With 473,000 square meters, it is one of the largest buildings ever built in the world
 It has a population of over 10,000 people, and of course, this is a scale that exceeds the comprehension of many things and the scale of typical architecture
 So we stopped work for a while and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks and glued them onto a model, just simply to confront ourselves with what that quantity actually meant
 So it was a way to script and design the building, but of course, also to communicate its experiences
This is the main broadcast control room, a technical installation so large, it can broadcast over 200 channels simultaneously
 And this is how the building stands in Beijing today
 Its first broadcast live was the London Olympics 2012, after it had been completed from the outside for the Beijing Olympics
 And you can see at the very tip of this 75-meter cantilever, those three little circles
 And they're indeed part of a public loop that goes through the building
 They're a piece of glass that you can stand on and watch the city pass by below you in slow motion
The building has become part of everyday life in Beijing
 It is there
 It has also become a very popular backdrop for wedding photography
But its most important moment is maybe sill this one
 "That's Beijing" is similar to "Time Out," a magazine that broadcasts what is happening in town during the week, and suddenly you see the building portrayed no longer as physical matter, but actually as an urban actor, as part of a series of personas that define the life of the city
 So architecture suddenly assumes the quality of a player, of something that writes stories and performs stories
 And I think that could be one of its primary meanings that we believe in
 It is the story of the people that made it -- 400 engineers and architects that I was guiding over almost a decade of collaborative work that we spent together in scripting this building, in imagining its reality and ultimately getting it built in China
This is a residential development in Singapore, large scale
 If we look at Singapore like most of Asia and more and more of the world, of course, it is dominated by the tower, a typology that indeed creates more isolation than connectedness, and I wanted to ask, how could we think about living, not only in terms of the privacy and individuality of ourselves and our apartment, but in an idea of a collective? How could we think about creating a communal environment in which sharing things was as great as having your own?
The typical answer to the question -- we had to design 1,040 apartments -- would have looked like this: 24-story height limit given by the planning authorities, 12 towers with nothing but residual in between -- a very tight system that, although the tower isolates you, it doesn't even give you privacy, because you're so close to the next one, that it is very questionable what the qualities of this would be
So I proposed to topple the towers, throw the vertical into the horizontal and stack them up, and what looks a bit random from the side, if you look from the viewpoint of the helicopter, you can see its organizational structure is actually a hexagonal grid, in which these horizontal building blocks are stacked up to create huge outdoor courtyards -- central spaces for the community, programmed with a variety of amenities and functions
 And you see that these courtyards are not hermetically sealed spaces
 They're open, permeable; they're interconnected
 We called the project "The Interlace," thinking that we interlace and interconnect the human beings and the spaces alike
 And the detailed quality of everything we designed was about animating the space and giving the space to the inhabitants
 And, in fact, it was a system where we would layer primarily communal spaces, stacked to more and more individual and private spaces
 So we would open up a spectrum between the collective and the individual
A little piece of math: if we count all the green that we left on the ground, minus the footprint of the buildings, and we would add back the green of all the terraces, we have 112 percent green space, so more nature than not having built a building
 And of course this little piece of math shows you that we are multiplying the space available to those who live there
 So you see new datum planes, new grounds planes for social activity
We paid a lot of attention to sustainability
 In the tropics, the sun is the most important thing to pay attention to, and, in fact, it is seeking protection from the sun
 We then went on to optimize the glazing of the facades to minimize the energy consumption of the building
 But most importantly, we could prove that through the geometry of the building design, the building itself would provide sufficient shading to the courtyards so that those would be usable throughout the entire year
 And it was the idea of creating this variety of choices, of freedom to think where you would want to be, where you would want to escape, maybe, within the own complexity of the complex in which you live
But coming from Asia to Europe: a building for a German media company based in Berlin, transitioning from the traditional print media to the digital media
 And its CEO asked a few very pertinent questions: Why would anyone today still want to go to the office, because you can actually work anywhere? And how could a digital identity of a company be embodied in a building? We created not only an object, but at the center of this object we created a giant space, and this space was about the experience of a collective, the experience of collaboration and of togetherness
 Communication, interaction as the center of a space that in itself would float, like what we call the collaborative cloud, in the middle of the building, surrounded by an envelope of standard modular offices
 So with only a few steps from your quiet work desk, you could participate in the giant collective experience of the central space
Finally, we come to London, a project commissioned by the London Legacy Development Corporation of the Mayor of London
 We were asked to undertake a study and investigate the potential of a site out in Stratford in the Olympic Park
 In the 19th century, Prince Albert had created Albertopolis
 And Boris Johnson thought of creating Olympicopolis
The idea was to bring together some of Britain's greatest institutions, some international ones, and to create a new system of synergies
 Prince Albert, as yet, created Albertopolis in the 19th century, thought of showcasing all achievements of mankind, bringing arts and science closer together
But of course, today's society has moved on from there
 We no longer live in a world in which everything is as clearly delineated or separated from each other
 We live in a world in which boundaries start to blur between the different domains, and in which collaboration and interaction becomes far more important than keeping separations
 So we wanted to think of a giant culture machine, a building that would orchestrate and animate the various domains, but allow them to interact and collaborate
 At the base of it is a very simple module, a ring module
 It can be glazed over and turned into a giant exhibitional performance space
 These modules were stacked together with the idea that almost any function could, over time, occupy any of these modules
 So institutions could shrink or contract, as, of course, the future of culture is, in a way, the most uncertain of all
 This is how the building sits, adjacent to the Aquatics Centre, opposite the Olympic Stadium
 And you can see how its cantilevering volumes project out and engage the public space and how its courtyards animate the public inside
The idea was to create a complex system in which institutional entities could maintain their own identity, in which they would not be subsumed in a singular volume
 Here's a scale comparison to the Centre Pompidou in Paris
 It both shows the enormous scale and potential of the project, but also the difference: here, it is a multiplicity of a heterogeneous structure, in which different entities can interact without losing their own identity
 And it was this thought: to create an organizational structure that would allow for multiple narratives to be scripted -- for those in the educational parts that create and think culture; for those that present the visual arts, the dance; and for the public to be admitted into all of this with a series of possible trajectories, to script their own reading of these narratives and their own experience
And I want to end on a project that is very small, in a way, very different: a floating cinema in the ocean of Thailand
 Friends of mine had founded a film festival, and I thought, if we think of the stories and narratives of movies, we should also think of the narratives of the people that watch them
 So I designed a small modular floating platform, based on the techniques of local fishermen, how they built their lobster and fish farms
 We collaborated with the local community and built, out of recycled materials of their own, this fantastical floating platform that gently moved in the ocean as we watched films from the British film archive, 1904 "Alice in Wonderland," for example
 The most primordial experiences of the audience merged with the stories of the movies
So I believe that architecture exceeds the domain of physical matter, of the built environment, but is really about how we want to live our lives, how we script our own stories and those of others
Thank you
I once said, "If you want to liberate a society, all you need is the Internet
" I was wrong
I said those words back in 2011, when a Facebook page I anonymously created helped spark the Egyptian revolution
 The Arab Spring revealed social media's greatest potential, but it also exposed its greatest shortcomings
 The same tool that united us to topple dictators eventually tore us apart
 I would like to share my own experience in using social media for activism, and talk about some of the challenges I have personally faced and what we could do about them
In the early 2000s, Arabs were flooding the web
 Thirsty for knowledge, for opportunities, for connecting with the rest of the people around the globe, we escaped our frustrating political realities and lived a virtual, alternative life
 Just like many of them, I was completely apolitical until 2009
 At the time, when I logged into social media, I started seeing more and more Egyptians aspiring for political change in the country
 It felt like I was not alone
 While browsing Facebook, I saw a photo, a terrifying photo, of a tortured, dead body of a young Egyptian guy
 His name was Khaled Said
 Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian who was killed by police
 I saw myself in his picture
 I thought, "I could be Khaled
"
 I anonymously created a Facebook page and called it "We are all Khaled Said
" In just three days, the page had over 100,000 people, fellow Egyptians who shared the same concern
I recruited my co-admin, AbdelRahman Mansour
 We were engaging them
 We were calling collectively for actions, and sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know
 The page became the most followed page in the Arab world
 It had more fans than established media organizations and even top celebrities
On January 14, 2011, Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia after mounting protests against his regime
 The 25th of January is Police Day
 It's a national holiday
 If 100,000 of us take to the streets of Cairo, no one is going to stop us
 I wonder if we could do it
"
In just a few days, the invitation reached over a million people, and over 100,000 people confirmed attendance
 Social media was crucial for this campaign
 It helped a decentralized movement arise
 It made people realize that they were not alone
 And it made it impossible for the regime to stop it
 At the time, they didn't even understand it
 And on January 25th, Egyptians flooded the streets of Cairo and other cities, calling for change, breaking the barrier of fear and announcing a new era
Then came the consequences
 A few hours before the regime cut off the Internet and telecommunications, I was walking in a dark street in Cairo, around midnight
 The government must be planning a massacre tomorrow
"
I was hit hard on my head
 I lost my balance and fell down, to find four armed men surrounding me
 One covered my mouth and the others paralyzed me
 I knew I was being kidnapped by state security
I found myself in a cell, handcuffed, blindfolded
 I was terrified
 So was my family, who started looking for me in hospitals, police stations and even morgues
After my disappearance, a few of my fellow colleagues who knew I was the admin of the page told the media about my connection with that page, and that I was likely arrested by state security
 My colleagues at Google started a search campaign trying to find me, and the fellow protesters in the square demanded my release
After 11 days of complete darkness, I was set free
 It was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life
 Egyptians lived a utopia for 18 days during the revolution
But unfortunately, the post-revolution events were like a punch in the gut
 The euphoria faded, we failed to build consensus, and the political struggle led to intense polarization
 Social media only amplified that state, by facilitating the spread of misinformation, rumors, echo chambers and hate speech
 The environment was purely toxic
 My online world became a battleground filled with trolls, lies, hate speech
 I started to worry about the safety of my family
 But of course, this wasn't just about me
 Both groups wanted you to side with them; you were either with them or against them
 And on the 3rd of July 2013, the army ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president, after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation
That day I made a very hard decision
 I decided to go silent, completely silent
 It was a moment of defeat
 I stayed silent for more than two years, and I used the time to reflect on everything that happened, trying to understand why did it happen
 It became clear to me that while it's true that polarization is primarily driven by our human behavior, social media shapes this behavior and magnifies its impact
 Say you want to say something that is not based on a fact, pick a fight or ignore someone that you don't like
 These are all natural human impulses, but because of technology, acting on these impulses is only one click away
In my view, there are five critical challenges facing today's social media
 Rumors that confirm people's biases are now believed and spread among millions of people
Second, we create our own echo chambers
 We tend to only communicate with people that we agree with, and thanks to social media, we can mute, un-follow and block everybody else
Third, online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs
 All of us probably know that
And fourth, it became really hard to change our opinions
 And once we do that, it lives forever on the Internet, and we are less motivated to change these views, even when new evidence arises
 It's as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other instead of talking with each other
I witnessed how these critical challenges contributed to an already polarized Egyptian society, but this is not just about Egypt
 Polarization is on the rise in the whole world
There's a lot of debate today on how to combat online harassment and fight trolls
 This is so important
 No one could argue against that
 But we need to also think about how to design social media experiences that promote civility and reward thoughtfulness
 I know for a fact if I write a post that is more sensational, more one-sided, sometimes angry and aggressive, I get to have more people see that post
 I will get more attention
We also need to think about effective crowdsourcing mechanisms, to fact-check widely spread online information, and reward people who take part in that
 In essence, we need to rethink today's social media ecosystem and redesign its experiences to reward thoughtfulness, civility and mutual understanding
As a believer in the Internet, I teamed up with a few friends, started a new project, trying to find answers and explore possibilities
 Our first product is a new media platform for conversations
 We're hosting conversations that promote mutual understanding and hopefully change minds
 We don't claim to have the answers, but we started experimenting with different discussions about very divisive issues, such as race, gun control, the refugee debate, relationship between Islam and terrorism
 These are conversations that matter
Today, at least one out of three people on the planet have access to the Internet
 But part of this Internet is being held captive by the less noble aspects of our human behavior
Five years ago, I said, "If you want to liberate society, all you need is the Internet
Thank you very much
I have been a police officer for a very, very long time
 And you see these notes in my hand because I'm also a black preacher
And if you know anything about black preachers, we'll close, and then we'll keep going for another 20 minutes
So I need this to keep pushing this thing forward
 I've been a police officer for a very long time, and I mean I predated technology
 I'm talking about before pagers
 I predate War on Our Fellow Man -- I mean, War on Drugs
 I predate all of that
 I predate so much and I've been through ebbs and flows and I've been through good and bad times, and still I absolutely love being a police officer
 I love being a police officer because it's always been a calling for me and never a job
 It's an invisible crisis, and it has been for many, many years
 Even though we in law enforcement say, "You know what? We can't arrest our way out of this
" We say in law enforcement things like, "Yeah, it's illegal to profile
" You know what? In law enforcement, we even agree that we have to adopt this thinking and become more oriented to community policing
 And yet all the while, still, we continue in the same vein, the same vein that contradicts everything that we just admitted
And so that's the reason for me, several years ago
 Because I was tired of the racism, I was tired of discrimination, I was tired of the "-isms" and the schisms
 I was just so tired
 I was tired of the vicious cycle, and I was tired of it even in the beloved agency in the department that I still love today
 And so my wife and I, we sat down and we decided and we targeted a date that we would retire
 We would retire and I would go off into the sunset, maybe do ministry full time, love my wife a long time
 Y'all know what I'm talking about
But we decided that I would retire
 But then there was a higher power than I
 So we didn't retire
 We didn't retire and so what happened was, over the next -- I would say, 18 months, 19 months, I had this passion to implement some radical policing
 And so now, over the next 19 months, I shifted, and I transcended from being a drug sergeant -- ready to retire as a drug sergeant -- and went from level to level to level, until I find myself as a district commander, commander of the worst district in Baltimore city
 We call it the Eastern District, the most violent district, the most impoverished district -- 46 percent unemployment in that district
 National rating at that time, national rating, the AIDS and the tuberculosis [rating], was always on the top 10 list for zip codes for cities across the nation, or just zip codes across the nation
 The top 10 -- I didn't say state, I didn't say city -- that little neighborhood
 We gotta do something different
 We gotta think radical
 We gotta think outside the box
 And so in order to bring change that I desperately wanted and I desperately felt in my heart, I had to start listening to that inner spirit
But we still did it
We had to change it
 And so what we did is we started to think holistically and not paramilitarily
 So we thought differently
 And so I decided to come to that intersection where I could meet all classes, all races, all creeds, all colors; where I would meet the businesses and the faith-based, and the eds, the meds, and I would meet all the people that made up the communities that I had authority over
So I met them and I began to listen
 See, police have a problem
 Off the top, we want to bring things into the community and come up with these extravagant strategies and deployments, but we never talk to the community about them
 And we shove them into the community and say, "Take that
" But we said we'd get rid of that stinkin' thinkin', so we talked to our communities
 We said, "This is your community table
 We'll pull up a chair
 We want to hear from you
 What's going to work in your community?" And then some great things started to happen
See, here's the thing: I had to figure out a way to shift 130 cops that were under my tutelage from being occupiers of communities to being partners
 I had to figure out how to do that
 Because here's the crazy thing: in law enforcement, we have evolved into something incredible
 Listen, we have become great protectors
 We know how to protect you
 But we have exercised that arm so much, so very much
 If I was a natural police department and I represented a police department, you would see this incredible, beautiful, 23-inch arm
It's pretty, ain't it? It's cut up
 No fat on it
 Mmm it look good
 It's led to coldness and callousness and dehumanized us
 And we've forgotten the mantra across this nation is to protect and serve
 Y'all don't know that? Protect and serve
You know, it's kinda weak
 It looks sickly
 It's withering and it's dying because we've invested so much in our protective arm
 But we forgot to treat our communities like they're our customers; like they're our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters, our mothers and fathers
 And so somehow, along the way, we've gotten out of balance
 It's even harder to make a change
And so, as I try to hurry and get through this, I need to say this: it's not just law enforcement, though
 Everybody makes up a community
 And as communities -- can I say this? -- we have put too much responsibility on law enforcement
 Too much
And then we have the audacity and the nerve to get upset with law enforcement when we take action
 There is no way in the world that we, as a community, should be calling the police for kids playing ball in the street
 No way in the world that we should be calling the police because my neighbor's music is up too loud, because his dog came over to my yard and did a number two; there's no way we should be calling the police
 But we have surrendered so much of our responsibility
 Listen, when I was a little boy coming up in Baltimore -- and listen, we played rough in the street -- I ain't never see the police come and break us up
 You know who came? It was the elders
 It was the parental figures in the community
 It was those guardians, it was that village mentality
 They came and said, "Stop that!" and "Do this
" and "Stop that
So it takes all of us, all of us
 And when I say community, I'm talking about everything that makes up a community, even -- listen, because I'm a preacher, I'm very hard on the churches, because I believe the churches too often have become MIA, missing in action
 So you now have churches who have become disconnected by default from the very community where they're planted
I could go on and on, but I really need to wrap this up
 Community and policing: we've all lost that precious gift, and I call it relational equity
 We've lost it with one another
 It's not somebody else's fault -- it's all of our fault
 But I say this: it's not too late for all of us to build our cities and nation to make it great again
 It is never too late
 You see, after three years of my four-and-a-half-year commandship in that district, three years in, after putting pastors in the car with my police because I knew this -- it's a little secret -- I knew this: it was hard to stay a nasty police officer while you're riding around with a clergy
You'd be getting in and out of the car, looking to your right, talking about: "Father, forgive me, for I have sinned," all day long -- you can't do it! So we came up with some incredible initiatives, engagements for our community and police to build that trust back
 We knew we had an economic problem, so we began to create jobs
 We knew there was sickness in our community and they didn't have access to proper medical care, so we'd partner up
 We got to that intersection and partnered up with anybody that wanted to partner with us and talked about what we needed holistically, never thinking about the crime
 Because at the end of the day, if we took care of the needs of the people, if we got to the root cause, the crime would take care of itself
And so, after three years of a four-and-a-half-year stint, we looked back and we looked over and found out that we were at a 40-year historical low: our crime numbers, our homicides -- everything had dropped down, back to the 1970s
 And it might go back further, but the problem is, we only started keeping data since 1970
 Forty-year crime low, so much so, I had other commanders call me, "Hey Mel, whatcha doin', man? Whatcha doin'? We gotta get some of that!"
 For the first time in 30 years, we fell, Baltimore city, to under 200 homicides -- 197 to be exact
 And we celebrated, because we had learned to become great servers, become great servers first
 They have broken my heart
 The uprising still hurts
 It still hurts my heart, because truly I believe that it should've never happened
 I believe it should've never happened if we were allowed to continue along the vein that we were in, servicing our community, treating them like human beings, treating them with respect, loving on them first
 If we continued in that vein, it would've never happened
 But somehow, we went back to business as usual
But I'm excited again! I'm excited again, because now we have a police commissioner who not only talks about community policing, but he absolutely understands it, and more importantly, he embraces it
 So I'm very excited now
 Listen, I'm excited about Baltimore today, because we, as many cities, I believe shall rise from the ashes
 I believe, as we continue to wrap arms and continue to say, "We're in this together," because it's not just an intersection: once we meet, we now gotta get on the same path for the same goals, and this city will become great again
 This nation will become great again
 Because we have the same goal: we all want peace
 We all want respect for one another
 We all want love
 And I believe we are back on that road, and I'm so excited about it
So listen, I thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time
God bless you all
God bless you
Late in January 1975, a 17-year-old German girl called Vera Brandes walked out onto the stage of the Cologne Opera House
 It was lit only by the dim, green glow of the emergency exit sign
 This was the most exciting day of Vera's life
 She was the youngest concert promoter in Germany, and she had persuaded the Cologne Opera House to host a late-night concert of jazz from the American musician, Keith Jarrett
 1,400 people were coming
 And in just a few hours, Jarrett would walk out on the same stage, he'd sit down at the piano and without rehearsal or sheet music, he would begin to play
But right now, Vera was introducing Keith to the piano in question, and it wasn't going well
 Jarrett looked to the instrument a little warily, played a few notes, walked around it, played a few more notes, muttered something to his producer
 Then the producer came over to Vera and said 
 "If you don't get a new piano, Keith can't play
"
There'd been a mistake
 The opera house had provided the wrong instrument
 The black notes were sticking, the white notes were out of tune, the pedals didn't work and the piano itself was just too small
So Keith Jarrett left
 He went and sat outside in his car, leaving Vera Brandes to get on the phone to try to find a replacement piano
 And so she went outside and she stood there in the rain, talking to Keith Jarrett, begging him not to cancel the concert
 And he looked out of his car at this bedraggled, rain-drenched German teenager, took pity on her, and said, "Never forget 
 only for you
"
And so a few hours later, Jarrett did indeed step out onto the stage of the opera house, he sat down at the unplayable piano and began
Within moments it became clear that something magical was happening
 Jarrett was avoiding those upper registers, he was sticking to the middle tones of the keyboard, which gave the piece a soothing, ambient quality
 And he stood up twisting, pounding down on the keys, desperately trying to create enough volume to reach the people in the back row
 It somehow has this peaceful quality, and at the same time it's full of energy, it's dynamic
 And the audience loved it
 Audiences continue to love it because the recording of the Köln Concert is the best-selling piano album in history and the best-selling solo jazz album in history
Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess
 He had embraced that mess, and it soared
 He didn't want to play
 Of course, I think any of us, in any remotely similar situation, would feel the same way, we'd have the same instinct
 We don't want to be asked to do good work with bad tools
 We don't want to have to overcome unnecessary hurdles
 But Jarrett's instinct was wrong, and thank goodness he changed his mind
 And I think our instinct is also wrong
 I think we need to gain a bit more appreciation for the unexpected advantages of having to cope with a little mess
 So let me give you some examples from cognitive psychology, from complexity science, from social psychology, and of course, rock 'n' roll
So cognitive psychology first
 And he asked them to reformat the handouts that they were giving to some of their classes
 So the regular handout would be formatted in something straightforward, such as Helvetica or Times New Roman
 But half these classes were getting handouts that were formatted in something sort of intense, like Haettenschweiler, or something with a zesty bounce, like Comic Sans italicized
 Now, these are really ugly fonts, and they're difficult fonts to read
 But at the end of the semester, students were given exams, and the students who'd been asked to read the more difficult fonts, had actually done better on their exams, in a variety of subjects
 And the reason is, the difficult font had slowed them down, forced them to work a bit harder, to think a bit more about what they were reading, to interpret it 
Another example
 The psychologist Shelley Carson has been testing Harvard undergraduates for the quality of their attentional filters
 What do I mean by that? What I mean is, imagine you're in a restaurant, you're having a conversation, there are all kinds of other conversations going on in the restaurant, you want to filter them out, you want to focus on what's important to you
 Can you do that? If you can, you have good, strong attentional filters
 But some people really struggle with that
 Some of Carson's undergraduate subjects struggled with that
 And so what that meant is they were constantly being interrupted by the sights and the sounds of the world around them
 If there was a television on while they were doing their essays, they couldn't screen it out
Now, you would think that that was a disadvantage 
 but no
 When Carson looked at what these students had achieved, the ones with the weak filters were vastly more likely to have some real creative milestone in their lives, to have published their first novel, to have released their first album
 These distractions were actually grists to their creative mill
 They were able to think outside the box because their box was full of holes
Let's talk about complexity science
 So how do you solve a really complex -- the world's full of complicated problems -- how do you solve a really complicated problem?
For example, you try to make a jet engine
 There are lots and lots of different variables, the operating temperature, the materials, all the different dimensions, the shape
 You can't solve that kind of problem all in one go, it's too hard
 So what do you do? Well, one thing you can do is try to solve it step-by-step
 So you have some kind of prototype and you tweak it, you test it, you improve it
 Now, this idea of marginal gains will eventually get you a good jet engine
 And it's been quite widely implemented in the world
 So you'll hear about it, for example, in high performance cycling, web designers will talk about trying to optimize their web pages, they're looking for these step-by-step gains
That's a good way to solve a complicated problem
 But you know what would make it a better way? A dash of mess
 You add randomness, early on in the process, you make crazy moves, you try stupid things that shouldn't work, and that will tend to make the problem-solving work better
 And if you start with the randomness, that becomes less likely, and your problem-solving becomes more robust
Let's talk about social psychology
 So the psychologist Katherine Phillips, with some colleagues, recently gave murder mystery problems to some students, and these students were collected in groups of four and they were given dossiers with information about a crime -- alibis and evidence, witness statements and three suspects
 And the groups of four students were asked to figure out who did it, who committed the crime
 And there were two treatments in this experiment
 In some cases these were four friends, they all knew each other well
 In other cases, three friends and a stranger
 And you can see where I'm going with this
Obviously I'm going to say that the groups with the stranger solved the problem more effectively, which is true, they did
 Actually, they solved the problem quite a lot more effectively
 So the groups of four friends, they only had a 50-50 chance of getting the answer right
 Which is actually not that great -- in multiple choice, for three answers? 50-50's not good
 That's quite a big leap in performance
 They were complacent
 and they were full of doubt
 And I think that really exemplifies the challenge that we're dealing with here
 these disruptions help us solve problems, they help us become more creative
 But we don't feel that they're helping us
 We feel that they're getting in the way 
 and so we resist
 And that's why the last example is really important
So I want to talk about somebody from the background of the world of rock 'n' roll
 And you may know him, he's actually a TED-ster
 He is an ambient composer -- rather brilliant
He's also a kind of catalyst behind some of the great rock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years
 He's worked with David Bowie on "Heroes," he worked with U2 on "Achtung Baby" and "The Joshua Tree," he's worked with DEVO, he's worked with Coldplay, he's worked with everybody
And what does he do to make these great rock bands better? Well, he makes a mess
 He disrupts their creative processes
 It's his role to be the awkward stranger
 It's his role to tell them that they have to play the unplayable piano
And one of the ways in which he creates this disruption is through this remarkable deck of cards -- I have my signed copy here -- thank you, Brian
 They're called The Oblique Strategies, he developed them with a friend of his
 And when they're stuck in the studio, Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards
 He'll draw one at random, and he'll make the band follow the instructions on the card
So this one 
 "Change instrument roles
" Yeah, everyone swap instruments -- Drummer on the piano -- Brilliant, brilliant idea
"Look closely at the most embarrassing details
"
"Make a sudden, destructive, unpredictable action
 Incorporate
"
These cards are disruptive
Now, they've proved their worth in album after album
 He got so frustrated he started throwing beer cans across the studio
 A checklist of things you might try if you got stuck
 Know why? Not messy enough
 Your eye would go down the list and it would settle on whatever was the least disruptive, the least troublesome, which of course misses the point entirely
And what Brian Eno came to realize was, yes, we need to run the stupid experiments, we need to deal with the awkward strangers, we need to try to read the ugly fonts
 These things help us
 They help us solve problems, they help us be more creative
But also 
 we really need some persuasion if we're going to accept this
 So however we do it 
Thank you
A few years ago, I got one of those spam emails
 And it managed to get through my spam filter
 I'm not quite sure how, but it turned up in my inbox, and it was from a guy called Solomon Odonkoh
I know
 it said, "Hello James Veitch, I have an interesting business proposal I want to share with you, Solomon
" Now, my hand was kind of hovering on the delete button, right? I was looking at my phone
 I thought, I could just delete this
 Or I could do what I think we've all always wanted to do
And I said, "Solomon, Your email intrigues me
"
And the game was afoot
He said, "Dear James Veitch, We shall be shipping Gold to you
"
"You will earn 10% of any gold you distributes
"
So I knew I was dealing with a professional
I said, "How much is it worth?"
5 million
"
I said, "Solomon, if we're going to do it, let's go big
I can handle it
 How much gold do you have?"
He said, "It is not a matter of how much gold I have, what matters is your capability of handling
 We can start with 50 kgs as trial shipment
"
I said, "50 kgs? There's no point doing this at all unless you're shipping at least a metric ton
"
He said, "What do you do for a living?"
I said, "I'm a hedge fund executive bank manager
This isn't the first time I've shipped bullion, my friend, no no no
Then I started to panic
 I was like, "Where are you based?" I don't know about you, but I think if we're going via the postal service, it ought to be signed for
 That's a lot of gold
He said, "It will not be easy to convince my company to do larger quantity shipment
"
I said, "Solomon, I'm completely with you on this one
 I'm putting together a visual for you to take into the board meeting
 Hold tight
"
This is what I sent Solomon
I said, "Solomon, attached to this email you'll find a helpful chart
 I've had one of my assistants run the numbers
We're ready for shipping as much gold as possible
"
There's always a moment where they try to tug your heartstrings, and this was it for Solomon
" And I said, "That's amazing, What are you going to spend your cut on?" And he said, "On RealEstate, what about you?"
I thought about it for a long time
 And I said, "One word; Hummus
"It's going places
He said, "I have to go bed now
"
"Till morrow
"
I didn't know what to say! I said, "Bonsoir my golden nugget, bonsoir
Guys, you have to understand, this had been going for, like, weeks, albeit hitherto the greatest weeks of my life, but I had to knock it on the head
 Friends were saying, "James, do you want to come for a drink?" I was like, "I can't, I'm expecting an email about some gold
"
 I had to take it to a ridiculous conclusion
 So I concocted a plan
 I said, "Solomon, I'm concerned about security
 When we email each other, we need to use a code
I said, "Solomon, I spent all night coming up with this code we need to use in all further correspondence:
 Fizzy Cola Bottle
 Jelly Beans
 A Giant Gummy Lizard
"
I knew these were all words they use, right? I said, "Please call me Kitkat in all further correspondence
I didn't hear back
 I thought, I've gone too far
 So I had to backpedal a little
 I said, "Solomon, Is the deal still on? KitKat
"
 Then I did get an email back from him
 He said, "The Business is on and I am trying to blah blah blah 
"
I said, "Dude, you have to use the code!" What followed is the greatest email I've ever received
I'm not joking, this is what turned up in my inbox
 This was a good day
 "The business is on
so he can submit all the needed Fizzy Cola Bottle Jelly Beans to the Creme Egg, for the Peanut M&Ms process to start
Send 1,500 pounds via a Giant Gummy Lizard
"
And that was so much fun, right, that it got me thinking: like, what would happen if I just spent as much time as could replying to as many scam emails as I could? And that's what I've been doing for three years on your behalf
Crazy stuff happens when you start replying to scam emails
 It's really difficult, and I highly recommend we do it
 I don't think what I'm doing is mean
 There are a lot of people who do mean things to scammers
And if you're going to do this -- and I highly recommend you do -- get yourself a pseudonymous email address
 Don't use your own email address
 That's what I was doing at the start and it was a nightmare
 I'd wake up in the morning and have a thousand emails about penis enlargements, only one of which was a legitimate response --
to a medical question I had
But I'll tell you what, though, guys, I'll tell you what: any day is a good day, any day is a good day if you receive an email that begins like this:
"I AM WINNIE MANDELA, THE SECOND WIFE OF NELSON MANDELA THE FORMER SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT
I know so many
Let that sink in
 She sent me this, which is hysterical
And this
 And this looks fairly legitimate, this is a letter of authorization
I said, "Winnie, I'm really sorry to hear of this
"
That's the worst health condition you can have, not being alive
She said, "KINDLY COMPLY WITH MY BANKERS INSTRUCTIONS
 ONE LOVE
 NO WOMAN, NO CRY
"
She said, "MY BANKER WILL NEED TRANSFER OF 3000 DOLLARS
"
I said, "no problemo
I SHOT THE SHERIFF
"

Thank you
 For example, during the Great Depression, they created the Hoover Dam, which in turn, created Lake Mead and made it possible for the cities of Las Vegas and Phoenix and Los Angeles to provide water for people who lived in a really dry place
In the 20th century, we literally spent trillions of dollars building infrastructure to get water to our cities
 But in the last decade, we've seen the combined effects of climate change, population growth and competition for water resources threaten these vital lifelines and water resources
This figure shows you the change in the lake level of Lake Mead that happened in the last 15 years
 You can see starting around the year 2000, the lake level started to drop
 And it was dropping at such a rate that it would have left the drinking water intakes for Las Vegas high and dry
 We like to complain about the navy showers we have to take
 We like our neighbors to see our dirty cars and our brown lawns
 But we've never really faced the prospect of turning on the tap and having nothing come out
 And that's because when things have gotten bad in the past, it's always been possible to expand a reservoir or dig a few more groundwater wells
 Well, in a time when all of the water resources are spoken for, it's not going to be possible to rely on this tried and true way of providing ourselves with water
 But that's an approach that's fraught with political, legal and social dangers
 And even if we succeed in grabbing the water from our rural neighbors, we're just transferring the problem to someone else and there's a good chance it will come back and bite us in the form of higher food prices and damage to the aquatic ecosystems that already rely upon that water
Now, if you told me 20 years ago that a modern city could exist without a supply of imported water, I probably would have dismissed you as an unrealistic and uninformed dreamer
 But my own experiences working with some of the world's most water-starved cities in the last decades have shown me that we have the technologies and the management skills to actually transition away from imported water, and that's what I want to tell you about tonight
 One of the great tragedies of urban development is that as our cities grew, we started covering all the surfaces with concrete and asphalt
 And when we did that, we had to build storm sewers to get the water that fell on the cities out before it could cause flooding, and that's a waste of a vital water resource
 Let me give you an example
This figure here shows you the volume of water that could be collected in the city of San Jose if they could harvest the stormwater that fell within the city limits
 You can see from the intersection of the blue line and the black dotted line that if San Jose could just capture half of the water that fell within the city, they'd have enough water to get them through an entire year
Now, I know what some of you are probably thinking
 "The answer to our problem is to start building great big tanks and attaching them to the downspouts of our roof gutters, rainwater harvesting
" Now, that's an idea that might work in some places
 But if you live in a place where it mainly rains in the winter time and most of the water demand is in the summertime, it's not a very cost-effective way to solve a water problem
 And if you experience the effects of a multiyear drought, like California's currently experiencing, you just can't build a rainwater tank that's big enough to solve your problem
 After all, many of our cities are sitting on top of a natural water storage system that can accommodate huge volumes of water
For example, historically, Los Angeles has obtained about a third of its water supply from a massive aquifer that underlies the San Fernando Valley
 Now, when you look at the water that comes off of your roof and runs off of your lawn and flows down the gutter, you might say to yourself, "Do I really want to drink that stuff?" Well, the answer is you don't want to drink it until it's been treated a little bit
 And so the challenge that we face in urban water harvesting is to capture the water, clean the water and get it underground
And that's exactly what the city of Los Angeles is doing with a new project that they're building in Burbank, California
 This figure here shows the stormwater park that they're building by hooking a series of stormwater collection systems, or storm sewers, and routing that water into an abandoned gravel quarry
 The water that's captured in the quarry is slowly passed through a man-made wetland, and then it goes into that ball field there and percolates into the ground, recharging the drinking water aquifer of the city
And in the process of passing through the wetland and percolating through the ground, the water encounters microbes that live on the surfaces of the plants and the surfaces of the soil, and that purifies the water
 And if the water's still not clean enough to drink after it's been through this natural treatment process, the city can treat it again when they pump if back out of the groundwater aquifers before they deliver it to people to drink
 Now, many of you are probably familiar with the concept of recycled water
 You've probably seen signs like this that tell you that the shrubbery and the highway median and the local golf course is being watered with water that used to be in a sewage treatment plant
 We've been doing this for a couple of decades now
 But what we're learning from our experience is that this approach is much more expensive that we expected it to be
 And that becomes prohibitive in terms of cost
What we're finding is that a much more cost-effective and practical way of recycling wastewater is to turn treated wastewater into drinking water through a two-step process
 In the first step in this process we pressurize the water and pass it through a reverse osmosis membrane: a thin, permeable plastic membrane that allows water molecules to pass through but traps and retains the salts, the viruses and the organic chemicals that might be present in the wastewater
In the second step in the process, we add a small amount of hydrogen peroxide and shine ultraviolet light on the water
After the water's been through this two-stage process, it's safe to drink
 I know, I've been studying recycled water using every measurement technique known to modern science for the past 15 years
 We've detected some chemicals that can make it through the first step in the process, but by the time we get to the second step, the advanced oxidation process, we rarely see any chemicals present
There's another way we can recycle water
 The treatment wetland receives water from a part of the Santa Ana River that in the summertime consists almost entirely of wastewater effluent from cities like Riverside and San Bernardino
 The water comes into our treatment wetland, it's exposed to sunlight and algae and those break down the organic chemicals, remove the nutrients and inactivate the waterborne pathogens
 The water gets put back in the Santa Ana River, it flows down to Anaheim, gets taken out at Anaheim and percolated into the ground, and becomes the drinking water of the city of Anaheim, completing the trip from the sewers of Riverside County to the drinking water supply of Orange County
 Well, in California, we already recycle about 40 billion gallons a year of wastewater through the two-stage advanced treatment process I was telling you about
 That's enough water to be the supply of about a million people if it were their sole water supply
The third tap that we need to open up will not be a tap at all, it will be a kind of virtual tap, it will be the water conservation that we manage to do
 And the place where we need to think about water conservation is outdoors because in California and other modern American cities, about half of our water use happens outdoors
In the current drought, we've seen that it's possible to have our lawns survive and our plants survive with about half as much water
 We can have California-friendly landscaping with soil moisture detectors and smart irrigation controllers and have beautiful green landscapes in our cities
The fourth and final water tap that we need to open up to solve our urban water problem will flow with desalinated seawater
 Now, I know what you probably heard people say about seawater desalination
 "It's a great thing to do if you have lots of oil, not a lot of water and you don't care about climate change
" Seawater desalination is energy-intensive no matter how you slice it
 But that characterization of seawater desalination as being a nonstarter is hopelessly out of date
 We've made tremendous progress in seawater desalination in the past two decades
This picture shows you the largest seawater desalination plant in the Western hemisphere that's currently being built north of San Diego
 Compared to the seawater desalination plant that was built in Santa Barbara 25 years ago, this treatment plant will use about half the energy to produce a gallon of water
But just because seawater desalination has become less energy-intensive, doesn't mean we should start building desalination plants everywhere
 Among the different choices we have, it's probably the most energy-intensive and potentially environmentally damaging of the options to create a local water supply
So there it is
 With these four sources of water, we can move away from our reliance on imported water
 Through reform in the way we landscape our surfaces and our properties, we can reduce outdoor water use by about 50 percent, thereby increasing the water supply by 25 percent
 We can recycle the water that makes it into the sewer, thereby increasing our water supply by 40 percent
 And we can make up the difference through a combination of stormwater harvesting and seawater desalination
 Let's create a water supply that uses local sources and leaves more water in the environment for fish and for food
 Let's create a water system that's consistent with out environmental values
 And let's do it for our children and our grandchildren and let's tell them this is the system that they have to take care of in the future because it's our last chance to create a new kind of water system
Thank you very much for your attention
I am in search of another planet in the universe where life exists
 I can't see this planet with my naked eyes or even with the most powerful telescopes we currently possess
 But I know that it's there
 And understanding contradictions that occur in nature will help us find it
 So we look for planets that orbit at just the right distance from their stars
 At this distance, shown in blue on this diagram for stars of different temperatures, planets could be warm enough for water to flow on their surfaces as lakes and oceans where life might reside
 Some astronomers focus their time and energy on finding planets at these distances from their stars
 What I do picks up where their job ends
 I model the possible climates of exoplanets
 And here's why that's important: there are many factors besides distance from its star that control whether a planet can support life
Take the planet Venus
 It's named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, because of its benign, ethereal appearance in the sky
 But spacecraft measurements revealed a different story
 The surface temperature is close to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, 500 Celsius
 That's hot enough to melt lead
 Its thick atmosphere, not its distance from the sun, is the reason
 It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids, trapping heat from the sun and scorching the planet's surface
 From these lessons from our own solar system, we've learned that a planet's atmosphere is crucial to its climate and potential to host life
We don't know what the atmospheres of these planets are like because the planets are so small and dim compared to their stars and so far away from us
 For example, one of the closest planets that could support surface water -- it's called Gliese 667 Cc -- such a glamorous name, right, nice phone number for a name -- it's 23 light years away
 So that's more than 100 trillion miles
 Trying to measure the atmospheric composition of an exoplanet passing in front of its host star is hard
 It's like trying to see a fruit fly passing in front of a car's headlight
 OK, now imagine that car is 100 trillion miles away, and you want to know the precise color of that fly
So I use computer models to calculate the kind of atmosphere a planet would need to have a suitable climate for water and life
Here's an artist's concept of the planet Kepler-62f, with the Earth for reference
 It's 1,200 light years away, and just 40 percent larger than Earth
 Our NSF-funded work found that it could be warm enough for open water from many types of atmospheres and orientations of its orbit
 So I'd like future telescopes to follow up on this planet to look for signs of life
Ice on a planet's surface is also important for climate
 Ice absorbs longer, redder wavelengths of light, and reflects shorter, bluer light
 Only the blue light makes it all the way to the bottom
 Then it gets reflected back to up to our eyes and we see blue ice
 My models show that planets orbiting cooler stars could actually be warmer than planets orbiting hotter stars
And it's no surprise that this is my specialty
 I'm an African-American female astronomer and a classically trained actor who loves to wear makeup and read fashion magazines, so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate contradictions in nature --
 and how they can inform our search for the next planet where life exists
My organization, Rising Stargirls, teaches astronomy to middle-school girls of color, using theater, writing and visual art
 That's another contradiction -- science and art don't often go together, but interweaving them can help these girls bring their whole selves to what they learn, and maybe one day join the ranks of astronomers who are full of contradictions, and use their backgrounds to discover, once and for all, that we are truly not alone in the universe
Roy Price is a man that most of you have probably never heard about, even though he may have been responsible for 22 somewhat mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013
 He may have also been responsible for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not very many of you
 And all of that goes back to a decision that Roy had to make about three years ago
So you see, Roy Price is a senior executive with Amazon Studios
 That's the TV production company of Amazon
 He's 47 years old, slim, spiky hair, describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos
" And Roy Price has a very responsible job, because it's his responsibility to pick the shows, the original content that Amazon is going to make
 I mean, there are so many TV shows already out there, that Roy can't just choose any show
 He has to find shows that are really, really great
 So in other words, he has to find shows that are on the very right end of this curve here
So this curve here is the rating distribution of about 2,500 TV shows on the website IMDB, and the rating goes from one to 10, and the height here shows you how many shows get that rating
 So if your show gets a rating of nine points or higher, that's a winner
 That's shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire," so all of these shows that are addictive, whereafter you've watched a season, your brain is basically like, "Where can I get more of these episodes?" That kind of show
 On the left side, just for clarity, here on that end, you have a show called "Toddlers and Tiaras" --
Now, Roy Price is not worried about getting on the left end of the curve, because I think you would have to have some serious brainpower to undercut "Toddlers and Tiaras
So the pressure is on, and of course it's also the first time that Amazon is even doing something like this, so Roy Price does not want to take any chances
 He wants to engineer success
So he takes a bunch of ideas for TV shows, and from those ideas, through an evaluation, they select eight candidates for TV shows, and then he just makes the first episode of each one of these shows and puts them online for free for everyone to watch
 And so when Amazon is giving out free stuff, you're going to take it, right? So millions of viewers are watching those episodes
 They are being watched by Roy Price and his team, who record everything
 They record when somebody presses play, when somebody presses pause, what parts they skip, what parts they watch again
 So they collect millions of data points, because they want to have those data points to then decide which show they should make
 And sure enough, so they collect all the data, they do all the data crunching, and an answer emerges, and the answer is, "Amazon should do a sitcom about four Republican US Senators
" They did that show
So does anyone know the name of the show?  Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems like not too many of you here remember that show, actually, because it didn't turn out that great
 It's actually just an average show, actually -- literally, in fact, because the average of this curve here is at 7
4, and "Alpha House" lands at 7
5, so a slightly above average show, but certainly not what Roy Price and his team were aiming for
 Meanwhile, however, at about the same time, at another company, another executive did manage to land a top show using data analysis, and his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, who is the Chief Content Officer of Netflix, and just like Roy, he's on a constant mission to find that great TV show, and he uses data as well to do that, except he does it a little bit differently
 So instead of holding a competition, what he did -- and his team of course -- was they looked at all the data they already had about Netflix viewers, you know, the ratings they give their shows, the viewing histories, what shows people like, and so on
 And then they use that data to discover all of these little bits and pieces about the audience: what kinds of shows they like, what kind of producers, what kind of actors
 And once they had all of these pieces together, they took a leap of faith, and they decided to license not a sitcom about four Senators but a drama series about a single Senator
Yes, "House of Cards," and Netflix of course, nailed it with that show, at least for the first two seasons
"House of Cards" gets a 9
 They connect all of these millions of data points, and then it works beautifully for one of them, and it doesn't work for the other one
 I mean, if you're collecting millions of data points on a decision you're going to make, then you should be able to make a pretty good decision
 You have 200 years of statistics to rely on
 You're amplifying it with very powerful computers
 The least you could expect is good TV, right?
 Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems? No one
 OK, that's good actually
If someone here in the US is in prison, and they apply for parole, then it's very likely that data analysis software from that company will be used in determining whether to grant that parole
 So it's the same principle as Amazon and Netflix, but now instead of deciding whether a TV show is going to be good or bad, you're deciding whether a person is going to be good or bad
 And mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be pretty bad, but more years in prison, I guess, even worse
And unfortunately, there is actually some evidence that this data analysis, despite having lots of data, does not always produce optimum results
 And that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn't know what to do with data
 Even the most data-savvy companies get it wrong
 Yes, even Google gets it wrong sometimes
" It worked beautifully for year after year after year, until one year it failed
 And nobody could even tell exactly why
 It just didn't work that year, and of course that again made big news, including now a retraction of a publication from the journal "Nature
" So even the most data-savvy companies, Amazon and Google, they sometimes get it wrong
 And despite all those failures, data is moving rapidly into real-life decision-making -- into the workplace, law enforcement, medicine
 So we should better make sure that data is helping
Now, personally I've seen a lot of this struggle with data myself, because I work in computational genetics, which is also a field where lots of very smart people are using unimaginable amounts of data to make pretty serious decisions like deciding on a cancer therapy or developing a drug
 And over the years, I've noticed a sort of pattern or kind of rule, if you will, about the difference between successful decision-making with data and unsuccessful decision-making, and I find this a pattern worth sharing, and it goes something like this
So whenever you're solving a complex problem, you're doing essentially two things
 The first one is, you take that problem apart into its bits and pieces so that you can deeply analyze those bits and pieces, and then of course you do the second part
 You put all of these bits and pieces back together again to come to your conclusion
 And sometimes you have to do it over again, but it's always those two things: taking apart and putting back together again
 Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help you taking a problem apart and understanding its pieces
 It's not suited to put those pieces back together again and then to come to a conclusion
And that's why I believe that Netflix was so successful, because they used data and brains where they belong in the process
 They use data to first understand lots of pieces about their audience that they otherwise wouldn't have been able to understand at that depth, but then the decision to take all these bits and pieces and put them back together again and make a show like "House of Cards," that was nowhere in the data
 They used data all the way to drive their decision-making, first when they held their competition of TV ideas, then when they selected "Alpha House" to make as a show
 Which of course was a very safe decision for them, because they could always point at the data, saying, "This is what the data tells us
" But it didn't lead to the exceptional results that they were hoping for
 No matter how powerful, data is just a tool, and to keep that in mind, I find this device here quite useful
 Many of you will 
Before there was data, this was the decision-making device to use
Many of you will know this
 I'll have it out later for tech demos
 But that does not change the basic setup
 So the ball may get smarter and smarter and smarter, but I believe it's still on us to make the decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary, on the right end of the curve
 Because in the end, it's not data, it's risks that will land you on the right end of the curve
Thank you
General relativity is unquestionably Einstein's masterpiece, a theory which reveals the workings of the universe at the grandest scales, capturing in one beautiful line of algebra everything from why apples fall from trees to the beginning of time and space
1915 must have been an exciting year to be a physicist
 Two new ideas were turning the subject on its head
 One was Einstein's theory of relativity, the other was arguably even more revolutionary: quantum mechanics, a mind-meltingly strange yet stunningly successful new way of understanding the microworld, the world of atoms and particles
Over the last century, these two ideas have utterly transformed our understanding of the universe
 It's thanks to relativity and quantum mechanics that we've learned what the universe is made from, how it began and how it continues to evolve
 Relativity and quantum mechanics appear to suggest that the universe should be a boring place
 But when we look around us, we see we live in a universe full of interesting stuff, full of stars, planets, trees, squirrels
 The question is, ultimately, why does all this interesting stuff exist? Why is there something rather than nothing? This contradiction is the most pressing problem in fundamental physics, and in the next few years, we may find out whether we'll ever be able to solve it
At the heart of this problem are two numbers, two extremely dangerous numbers
 These are properties of the universe that we can measure, and they're extremely dangerous because if they were different, even by a tiny bit, then the universe as we know it would not exist
 The first of these numbers is associated with the discovery that was made a few kilometers from this hall, at CERN, home of this machine, the largest scientific device ever built by the human race, the Large Hadron Collider
 The LHC whizzes subatomic particles around a 27-kilometer ring, getting them closer and closer to the speed of light before smashing them into each other inside gigantic particle detectors
 On July 4, 2012, physicists at CERN announced to the world that they'd spotted a new fundamental particle being created at the violent collisions at the LHC: the Higgs boson
Now, if you followed the news at the time, you'll have seen a lot of physicists getting very excited indeed, and you'd be forgiven for thinking we get that way every time we discover a new particle
 Well, that is kind of true, but the Higgs boson is particularly special
 We all got so excited because finding the Higgs proves the existence of a cosmic energy field
 Now, you may have trouble imagining an energy field, but we've all experienced one
 If you've ever held a magnet close to a piece of metal and felt a force pulling across that gap, then you've felt the effect of a field
 And the Higgs field is a little bit like a magnetic field, except it has a constant value everywhere
 We can't see it or touch it, but if it wasn't there, we would not exist
 The Higgs field gives mass to the fundamental particles that we're made from
 If it wasn't there, those particles would have no mass, and no atoms could form and there would be no us
But there is something deeply mysterious about the Higgs field
 It should either be off, so that it has a zero value everywhere in space, or it should be on so it has an absolutely enormous value
 In both of these scenarios, atoms could not exist, and therefore all the other interesting stuff that we see around us in the universe would not exist
 In reality, the Higgs field is just slightly on, not zero but 10,000 trillion times weaker than its fully on value, a bit like a light switch that's got stuck just before the off position
 And this value is crucial
 If it were a tiny bit different, then there would be no physical structure in the universe
So this is the first of our dangerous numbers, the strength of the Higgs field
 Theorists have spent decades trying to understand why it has this very peculiarly fine-tuned number, and they've come up with a number of possible explanations
 They have sexy-sounding names like "supersymmetry" or "large extra dimensions
" I'm not going to go into the details of these ideas now, but the key point is this: if any of them explained this weirdly fine-tuned value of the Higgs field, then we should see new particles being created at the LHC along with the Higgs boson
 So far, though, we've not seen any sign of them
But there's actually an even worse example of this kind of fine-tuning of a dangerous number, and this time it comes from the other end of the scale, from studying the universe at vast distances
 One of the most important consequences of Einstein's general theory of relativity was the discovery that the universe began as a rapid expansion of space and time 13
8 billion years ago, the Big Bang
 Now, according to early versions of the Big Bang theory, the universe has been expanding ever since with gravity gradually putting the brakes on that expansion
 But in 1998, astronomers made the stunning discovery that the expansion of the universe is actually speeding up
 The universe is getting bigger and bigger faster and faster driven by a mysterious repulsive force called dark energy
Now, whenever you hear the word "dark" in physics, you should get very suspicious because it probably means we don't know what we're talking about
We don't know what dark energy is, but the best idea is that it's the energy of empty space itself, the energy of the vacuum
 You find that dark energy should be 10 to the power of 120 times stronger than the value we observe from astronomy
 That's one with 120 zeroes after it
 This is a number so mind-bogglingly huge that it's impossible to get your head around
 We often use the word "astronomical" when we're talking about big numbers
 Well, even that one won't do here
 It's a thousand trillion trillion trillion times bigger than the number of atoms in the entire universe
So that's a pretty bad prediction
 If dark energy were anywhere near this strong, then the universe would have been torn apart, stars and galaxies could not form, and we would not be here
 So this is the second of those dangerous numbers, the strength of dark energy, and explaining it requires an even more fantastic level of fine-tuning than we saw for the Higgs field
 But unlike the Higgs field, this number has no known explanation
The hope was that a complete combination of Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is the theory of the universe at grand scales, with quantum mechanics, the theory of the universe at small scales, might provide a solution
 Einstein himself spent most of his later years on a futile search for a unified theory of physics, and physicists have kept at it ever since
One of the most promising candidates for a unified theory is string theory, and the essential idea is, if you could zoom in on the fundamental particles that make up our world, you'd see actually that they're not particles at all, but tiny vibrating strings of energy, with each frequency of vibration corresponding to a different particle, a bit like musical notes on a guitar string
 It turns out that string theory isn't one theory at all, but a whole collection of theories
 It's been estimated, in fact, that there are 10 to the 500 different versions of string theory
 Each one would describe a different universe with different laws of physics
 Now, critics say this makes string theory unscientific
 You can't disprove the theory
 But others actually turned this on its head and said, well, maybe this apparent failure is string theory's greatest triumph
 In most of the multiverse, dark energy is so strong that the universe gets torn apart, or the Higgs field is so weak that no atoms can form
 We live in one of the places in the multiverse where the two numbers are just right
 We live in a Goldilocks universe
Now, this idea is extremely controversial, and it's easy to see why
 Even worse, we can't test the idea of the multiverse
 We can't access these other universes, so there's no way of knowing whether they're there or not
So we're in an extremely frustrating position
 That doesn't mean the multiverse doesn't exist
 There are other planets, other stars, other galaxies, so why not other universes? The problem is, it's unlikely we'll ever know for sure
 Now, the idea of the multiverse has been around for a while, but in the last few years, we've started to get the first solid hints that this line of reasoning may get born out
 My experiment published paper after paper where we glumly had to conclude that we saw no signs of new physics
 This summer, the LHC began its second phase of operation with an energy almost double what we achieved in the first run
 What particle physicists are all desperately hoping for are signs of new particles, micro black holes, or maybe something totally unexpected emerging from the violent collisions at the Large Hadron Collider
 If so, then we can continue this long journey that began 100 years ago with Albert Einstein towards an ever deeper understanding of the laws of nature
Thank you
 Harry, even if you just said the science may not have some answers, I would like to ask you a couple of questions, and the first is: building something like the LHC is a generational project
 I just mentioned, introducing you, that we live in a short-term world
 How do you think so long term, projecting yourself out a generation when building something like this?
 I was very lucky that I joined the experiment I work on at the LHC in 2008, just as we were switching on, and there are people in my research group who have been working on it for three decades, their entire careers on one machine
 So I think the first conversations about the LHC were in 1976, and you start planning the machine without the technology that you know you're going to need to be able to build it
 So the computing power did not exist in the early '90s when design work began in earnest
 One of the big detectors which record these collisions, they didn't think there was technology that could withstand the radiation that would be created in the LHC, so there was basically a lump of lead in the middle of this object with some detectors around the outside, but subsequently we have developed technology
 So you have to rely on people's ingenuity, that they will solve the problems, but it may be a decade or more down the line
 China just announced two or three weeks ago that they intend to build a supercollider twice the size of the LHC
 I was wondering how you and your colleagues welcome the news
 Size isn't everything, Bruno
 BG: I'm sure
 I'm sure
 But I mean, seriously, it's great news
 So it's only a good thing
 What they're really planning to do is to build a machine that will study the Higgs boson in detail and could give us some clues as to whether these new ideas, like supersymmetry, are really out there, so it's great news for physics, I think
 Harry, thank you
 HC: Thank you very much
What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life? If you were going to invest now in your future best self, where would you put your time and your energy? There was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their most important life goals were, and over 80 percent said that a major life goal for them was to get rich
 And another 50 percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous
And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder and achieve more
 We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life
 Pictures of entire lives, of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them, those pictures are almost impossible to get
 Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past, and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20
 We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life, and sometimes memory is downright creative
But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time? What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy?
We did that
 The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done
 For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men, year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health, and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out
 Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study, or funding for the research dries up, or the researchers get distracted, or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field
 But through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers, this study has survived
 And I'm the fourth director of the study
Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men
 The first group started in the study when they were sophomores at Harvard College
 They all finished college during World War II, and then most went off to serve in the war
 And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods, boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s
 Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water
When they entered the study, all of these teenagers were interviewed
 We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents
 And then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life
 They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors, one President of the United States
 Some developed alcoholism
 A few developed schizophrenia
The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later, telling you that the study still continues
 Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives
Many of the inner city Boston men ask us, "Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting
" The Harvard men never ask that question
To get the clearest picture of these lives, we don't just send them questionnaires
 We interview them in their living rooms
 We get their medical records from their doctors
 We draw their blood, we scan their brains, we talk to their children
 And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study, many of the women said, "You know, it's about time
"
So what have we learned? What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives? Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder
 The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this: Good relationships keep us happier and healthier
 Period
We've learned three big lessons about relationships
 The first is that social connections are really good for us, and that loneliness kills
 It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected
 And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic
 People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely
 And the sad fact is that at any given time, more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely
And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters
 It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health
 High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection, turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced
 And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective
Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian and who wasn't
 And when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old
 It was how satisfied they were in their relationships
 The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80
 And good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old
 Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that on the days when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as happy
 But the people who were in unhappy relationships, on the days when they reported more physical pain, it was magnified by more emotional pain
And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brains
 And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time
 Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories
So this message, that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being, this is wisdom that's as old as the hills
 Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore? Well, we're human
 Relationships are messy and they're complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous
 It's also lifelong
 It never ends
 The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates
 Just like the millennials in that recent survey, many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life
 But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships, with family, with friends, with community
 What might leaning in to relationships even look like?
Well, the possibilities are practically endless
 It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together, long walks or date nights, or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years, because those all-too-common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges
I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain
 More than a century ago, he was looking back on his life, and he wrote this: "There isn't time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account
 There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that
"
The good life is built with good relationships
Thank you
Ten years ago, I had my first exhibition here
 I had no idea if it would work or was at all possible, but with a few small steps and a very steep learning curve, I made my first sculpture, called "The Lost Correspondent
" Teaming up with a marine biologist and a local dive center, I submerged the work off the coast of Grenada, in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan
 And then this incredible thing happened
 It transformed
 One sculpture became two
 Two quickly became 26
 And before I knew it, we had the world's first underwater sculpture park
In 2009, I moved to Mexico and started by casting local fisherman
 This grew to a small community, to almost an entire movement of people in defense of the sea
 And then finally, to an underwater museum, with over 500 living sculptures
 Gardening, it seems, is not just for greenhouses
 We've since scaled up the designs: "Ocean Atlas," in the Bahamas, rising 16 feet up to the surface and weighing over 40 tons, to now currently in Lanzarote, where I'm making an underwater botanical garden, the first of its kind in the Atlantic Ocean
Each project, we use materials and designs that help encourage life; a long-lasting pH-neutral cement provides a stable and permanent platform
 It is textured to allow coral polyps to attach
 We position them down current from natural reefs so that after spawning, there's areas for them to settle
 The formations are all configured so that they aggregate fish on a really large scale
 Even this VW Beetle has an internal living habitat to encourage crustaceans such as lobsters and sea urchins
So why exhibit my work in the ocean? Because honestly, it's really not easy
 When you're in the middle of the sea under a hundred-foot crane, trying to lower eight tons down to the sea floor, you start to wonder whether I shouldn't have taken up watercolor painting instead
The ocean is the most incredible exhibition space an artist could ever wish for
 You have amazing lighting effects changing by the hour, explosions of sand covering the sculptures in a cloud of mystery, a unique timeless quality and the procession of inquisitive visitors, each lending their own special touch to the site
But over the years, I've realized that the greatest thing about what we do, the really humbling thing about the work, is that as soon as we submerge the sculptures, they're not ours anymore, because as soon as we sink them, the sculptures, they belong to the sea
 It's a bit of a cliché, but nothing man-made can ever match the imagination of nature
 Staghorn coral morphs the form
 Fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed
 Sea urchins crawl across the bodies feeding at night
 Coralline algae applies a kind of purple paint
 The deepest red I've ever seen in my life lives underwater
 Gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves
 Purple sponges breathe water like air
 And grey angelfish glide silently overhead
 I'm standing here today on this boat in the middle of the ocean, and this couldn't be a better place to talk about the really, really important effect of my work
 Because as we all know, our reefs are dying, and our oceans are in trouble
 the most used, searched and shared image of all my work thus far is this
 What I really hope is that people are beginning to understand that when we think of the environment and the destruction of nature, that we need to start thinking about our oceans, too
Since building these sites, we've seen some phenomenal and unexpected results
 Besides creating over 800 square meters of new habitats and living reef, visitors to the marine park in Cancun now divide half their time between the museum and the natural reefs, providing significant rest for natural, overstressed areas
 Visitors to "Ocean Atlas" in the Bahamas highlighted a leak from a nearby oil refinery
 The sculpture park in Grenada was instrumental in the government designating a spot -- a marine-protected area
 Entrance fees to the park now help fund park rangers to manage tourism and fishing quotas
 The site was actually listed as a "Wonder of the World" by National Geographic
So why are we all here today in this room? What do we all have in common? I think we all share a fear that we don't protect our oceans enough
 And one way of thinking about this is that we don't regard our oceans as sacred, and we should
 When we see incredible places -- like the Himalayas or the La Sagrada Família, or the Mona Lisa, even -- when we see these incredible places and things, we understand their importance
 We call them sacred, and we do our best to cherish them, to protect them and to keep them safe
 But in order to do that, we are the ones that have to assign that value; otherwise, it will be desecrated by someone who doesn't understand that value
So I want to finish up tonight by talking about sacred things
 When we were naming the site in Cancun, we named it a museum for a very important and simple reason: museums are places of preservation, of conservation and of education
 They're places where we keep objects of great value to us, where we simply treasure them for them being themselves
 If someone wanted to build a seven-star hotel at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, then we would laugh them out of Arizona
 Yet every day we dredge, pollute and overfish our oceans
 And I think it's easier for us to do that, because when we see the ocean, we don't see the havoc we're wreaking
 Because for most people, the ocean is like this
 And it's really hard to think of something that's just so plain and so enormous, as fragile
 It's simply too massive, too vast, too endless
 And what do you see here? I think most people actually look past to the horizon
 So I think there's a real danger that we never really see the sea, and if we don't really see it, if it doesn't have its own iconography, if we miss its majesty, then there's a big danger that we take it for granted
Cancun is famous for spring break, tequila and foam parties
 But because of our work there, there's now a little corner of Cancun that is simply precious for being itself
 And we don't want to stop in Grenada, in Cancun or the Bahamas
 Just last month, I installed these Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in the Thames River, in central London, right in front of the Houses of Parliament, putting a stark message about climate change in front of the people that have the power to help change things
 We want to team up with other inventors, creators, philanthropists, educators, biologists, to see better futures for our oceans
 And we want to see beyond sculpture, beyond art, even
 And instead of getting taken to the natural history museum or an aquarium, you get taken out to the ocean, to an underwater Noah's Ark, which you can access through a dry-glass viewing tunnel, where you can see all the wildlife of the land be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean
 Clearly, it would blow your mind
So let's think big and let's think deep
 Who knows where our imagination and willpower can lead us? I hope that by bringing our art into the ocean, that not only do we take advantage of amazing creativity and visual impact of the setting, but that we are also giving something back, and by encouraging new environments to thrive, and in some way opening up a new -- or maybe it's a really old way of seeing the seas: as delicate, precious places, worthy of our protection
Our oceans are sacred
Thank you
In 2008, Burhan Hassan, age 17, boarded a flight from Minneapolis to the Horn of Africa
 And while Burhan was the youngest recruit, he was not alone
 Al-Shabaab managed to recruit over two dozen young men in their late teens and early 20s with a heavy presence on social media platforms like Facebook
 With the Internet and other technologies, they've changed our everyday lives, but they've also changed recruitment, radicalization and the front lines of conflict today
What about the links connecting Twitter, Google and protesters fighting for democracy? These numbers represent Google's public DNS servers, effectively the only digital border crossing protesters had and could use to communicate with each other, to reach the outside world and to spread viral awareness of what was happening in their own country
Today, conflict is essentially borderless
 If there are bounds to conflict today, they're bound by digital, not physical geography
 And under all this is a vacuum of power where non-state actors, individuals and private organizations have the advantage over slow, outdated military and intelligence agencies
To understand the pace of our own government thinking on this, I like to turn to something aptly named the Worldwide Threat Assessment, where every year the Director of National Intelligence in the US looks at the global threat landscape, and he says, "These are the threats, these are the details, and this is how we rank them
" In 2007, there was absolutely no mention of cyber security
 In 2012, it crept up, still behind things like terrorism and proliferation
 In 2013, it became the top threat, in 2014 and for the foreseeable future
What things like that show us is that there is a fundamental inability today on the part of governments to adapt and learn in digital conflict, where conflict can be immaterial, borderless, often wholly untraceable
 And conflict isn't just online to offline, as we see with terrorist radicalization, but it goes the other way as well
 What an individual hacker or a small group of anonymous individuals did was enter those social media conversations that so many of us took part in
 #JeSuisCharlie
 On Facebook, on Twitter, on Google, all sorts of places where millions of people, myself included, were talking about the events and saw images like this, the emotional, poignant image of a baby with "Je suis Charlie" on its wrist
 And this turned into a weapon
 What the hackers did was weaponize this image, where unsuspecting victims, like all of us in those conversations, saw this image, downloaded it but it was embedded with malware
 And so when you downloaded this image, it hacked your system
 It took six days to deploy a global malware campaign
And it goes the other way as well, with recruitment
With all of this, we see that there's a new 21st century battle brewing, and governments don't necessarily take a part
So in another case, Anonymous vs
 Los Zetas
 In early September 2011 in Mexico, Los Zetas, one of the most powerful drug cartels, hung two bloggers with a sign that said, "This is what will happen to all Internet busybodies
" A week later, they beheaded a young girl
 And taking the digital counteroffensive because governments couldn't even understand what was going on or act, Anonymous, a group we might not associate as the most positive force in the world, took action, not in cyber attacks, but threatening information to be free
 On social media, they said, "We will release information that ties prosecutors and governors to corrupt drug deals with the cartel
" And so it ended there because it would become too gruesome to continue
 But what was powerful about this was that anonymous individuals, not federal policia, not military, not politicians, could strike fear deep into the heart of one of the most powerful, violent organizations in the world
 And so we live in an era that lacks the clarity of the past in conflict, in who we're fighting, in the motivations behind attacks, in the tools and techniques used, and how quickly they evolve
 And the question still remains: what can individuals, organizations and governments do?
For answers to these questions, it starts with individuals, and I think peer-to-peer security is the answer
 Those people in relationships that bought over teens online, we can do that with peer-to-peer security
 And we can create those positive peer-to-peer relationships on and offline, we can support and educate the next generation of hackers, like myself, instead of saying, "You can either be a criminal or join the NSA
" That matters today
 And it's not just individuals -- it's organizations, corporations even
 They have an advantage to act across more borders, more effectively and more rapidly than governments can, and there's a set of real incentives there
 It's profitable and valuable to be seen as trustworthy in the digital age, and will only be more so in future generations to come
 But we see where that's gotten us so far, where there's an inability to adapt and learn in digital conflict, where at the highest levels of leadership, the Director of the CIA, Secretary of Defense, they say, "Cyber Pearl Harbor will happen
" But this only makes us more fearful, not more secure
 By banning encryption in favor of mass surveillance and mass hacking, sure, GCHQ and the NSA can spy on you
 But that doesn't mean that they're the only ones that can
 Capabilities are cheap, even free
 Technical ability is rising around the world, and individuals and small groups have the advantage
 So today it might just be the NSA and GCHQ, but who's to say that the Chinese can't find that backdoor? Or in another generation, some kid in his basement in Estonia?
And so I would say that it's not what governments can do, it's that they can't
 Governments today need to give up power and control in order to help make us more secure
 Giving up mass surveillance and hacking and instead fixing those backdoors means that, yeah, they can't spy on us, but neither can the Chinese or that hacker in Estonia a generation from now
And so it should be not fearful, it should be inspiring to the same governments that fought for civil rights, free speech and democracy in the great wars of the last century, that today, for the first time in human history, we have a technical opportunity to make billions of people safer around the world that we've never had before in human history
 It should be inspiring
 Commissioner, thank you for coming to TED
 Pleasure
 Let's start with a figure
 During 2015, almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe from many different countries, of course, from Syria and Iraq, but also from Afghanistan and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere
 But I want to look at it a little bit from the short-term and the long-term perspective
 And the first question is very simple: Why has the movement of refugees spiked so fast in the last six months?
 Well, I think, basically, what triggered this huge increase was the Syrian refugee group
 There has been an increased movement into Europe from Africa, from Asia, but slowly growing, and all of a sudden we had this massive increase in the first months of this year
 Why? I think there are three reasons, two long-term ones and the trigger
 The long-term ones, in relation to Syrians, is that hope is less and less clear for people
 I mean, they look at their own country and they don't see much hope to go back home, because there is no political solution, so there is no light at the end of the tunnel
 Second, the living conditions of the Syrians in the neighboring countries have been deteriorating
 We just had research with the World Bank, and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon live below the national poverty lines
 Only half of the children go to school, which means that people are living very badly
 Not only are they refugees, out of home, not only have they suffered what they have suffered, but they are living in very, very dramatic conditions
And then the trigger was when all of a sudden, international aid decreased
 The World Food Programme was forced, for lack of resources, to cut by 30 percent food support to the Syrian refugees
 They're not allowed to work, so they are totally dependent on international support, and they felt, "The world is abandoning us
" And that, in my opinion, was the trigger
 All of a sudden, there was a rush, and people started to move in large numbers and, to be absolutely honest, if I had been in the same situation and I would have been brave enough to do it, I think I would have done the same
 The war in Syria has been happening for five years
 Millions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around Syria
 Well, unprepared because divided, and when you are divided, you don't want to recognize the reality
 You prefer to postpone decisions, because you do not have the capacity to make them
 And the proof is that even when the spike occurred, Europe remained divided and was unable to put in place a mechanism to manage the situation
 You talk about one million people
 Now, in Lebanon, we have one refugee per three Lebanese
 And Lebanon? Struggling, of course, but it's managing
 So, the question is: is this something that could have been managed if -- not mentioning the most important thing, which would have been addressing the root causes, but forgetting about root causes for now, looking at the phenomenon as it is -- if Europe were able to come together in solidarity to create an adequate reception capacity of entry points? But for that, the countries at entry points need to be massively supported, and then screening the people with security checks and all the other mechanisms, distributing those that are coming into all European countries, according to the possibilities of each country
 I mean, if you look at the relocation program that was approved by the Commission, always too little too late, or by the Council, too little too late --
 It's already breaking down
 My country is supposed to receive four thousand
 Four thousand in Portugal means nothing
 So this is perfectly manageable if it is managed, but in the present circumstances, the pressure is at the point of entry, and then, as people move in this chaotic way through the Balkans, then they come to Germany, Sweden, basically, and Austria
 Let me try to bring up three questions, playing a bit devil's advocate
 But I think the questions are very present in the minds of many people in Europe right now, The first, of course, is about numbers
 You say 550 million versus one million is not much, but realistically, how many people can Europe take?
 Well, that is a question that has no answer, because refugees have the right to be protected
 And there is such a thing as international law, so there is no way you can say, "I take 10,000 and that's finished
" Turkey has now two million three-hundred thousand or something of the sort, if you count all refugees
So I don't think it's fair to say how many we can take
 What it is fair to say is: how we can we organize ourselves to assume our international responsibilities? And Europe has not been able to do so, because basically, Europe is divided because there is no solidarity in the European project
 And it's not only about refugees; there are many other areas
 And let's be honest, this is the moment in which we need more Europe instead of less Europe
 But as the public less and less believes in European institutions, it is also each time more difficult to convince the public that we need more Europe to solve these problems
 We seem to be at the point where the numbers turn into political shifts, particularly domestically
 We saw it again this weekend in France, but we have seen it over and over in many countries: in Poland and in Denmark and in Switzerland and elsewhere, where the mood changes radically because of the numbers, although they are not very significant in absolute numbers
 The Prime Minister of --
 But, if I may, on these: I mean, what does a European see at home in a village where there are no migrants? What a European sees is, on television, every single day, a few months ago, opening the news every single day, a crowd coming, uncontrolled, moving from border to border, and the images on television were of hundreds or thousands of people moving
" So there was this completely false idea that Europe was being invaded and our way of life is going to change, and everything will -- And the problem is that if this had been properly managed, if people had been properly received, welcomed, sheltered at point of entry, screened at point of entry, and the moved by plane to different European countries, this would not have scared people
 But, unfortunately, we have a lot of people scared, just because Europe was not able to do the job properly
 So, what's your position? How do you imagine these people reacting?
 If there would be a proper management of the situation and the proper distribution of people all over Europe, you would always have the percentage that I mentioned: one per each 2,000
 It is because things are not properly managed that in the end we have situations that are totally impossible to live with, and of course if you have a village -- in Lebanon, there are many villages that have more Syrians than Lebanese; Lebanon has been living with that
 I'm not asking for the same to happen in Europe, for all European villages to have more refugees than inhabitants
 What I am asking is for Europe to do the job properly, and to be able to organize itself to receive people as other countries in the world were forced to do in the past
 So, if you look at the global situation not only at Europe --
 Yes!
 If you look at the global situation, so, not only at Europe, I know you can make a long list of countries that are not really stepping up, but I'm more interested in the other part -- is there somebody who's doing the right thing?
 Well, 86 percent of the refugees in the world are in the developing world
 And if you look at countries like Ethiopia -- Ethiopia has received more than 600,000 refugees
 All the borders in Ethiopia are open
 And they have, as a policy, they call the "people to people" policy that every refugee should be received
 And they have South Sudanese, they have Sudanese, they have Somalis
 They have all the neighbors
 They have Eritreans
 And, in general, African countries are extremely welcoming of refugees coming, and I would say that in the Middle East and in Asia, we have seen a tendency for borders to be open
 The truth is that for Afghans, the borders of Pakistan and Iran were open for, at the time, six million Afghans that came
 The trend in the developed world is for these questions to become more and more complex, especially when there is, in the public opinion, a mixture of discussions between refugee protections on one side and security questions -- in my opinion, misinterpreted -- on the other side
 We'll come back to that too, but you mentioned the cutting of funding and the vouchers from the World Food Programme
 That reflects the general underfunding of the organizations working on these issues
 Now that the world seems to have woken up, are you getting more funding and more support, or it's still the same?
 We are getting more support
 I would say that we are coming close to the levels of last year
 We were much worse during the summer
 Now, today this doesn't make any sense, because they are providing a global public good
 And they are not
 And not only do the refugees live in very dramatic circumstances inside those countries, but the local communities themselves are suffering, because salaries went down, because there are more unemployed, because prices and rents went up
 Who should be providing this support? Country by country, international organizations, the European Union? Who should be coming up with this support?
 We need to join all efforts
 It's clear that bilateral cooperation is essential
 It's clear that multilateral cooperation is essential
 You are talking about things that require a long-term perspective, a development perspective and not only an emergency humanitarian aid perspective
 I would like your comment on something that was in newspapers this morning
 It is a statement made by the current front-runner for the Republican nomination for US President, Donald Trump
 Yesterday, he said this
No, listen to this
 It's interesting
" How do you react to that?
 Well, it's not only Donald Trump
 And the reason why they say this is because they think that by doing or saying this, they are protecting the security of their countries
 Now, I've been in government
 I am very keen on the need for governments to protect the security of their countries and their people
 But if you say, like that, in the US or in any European country, "We are going to close our doors to Muslim refugees," what you are saying is the best possible help for the propaganda of terrorist organizations
What you are saying will be heard by all the Muslims in your own country, and it will pave the way for the recruitment and the mechanisms that, through technology, Daesh and al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, and all those other groups are today penetrating in our societies
 And it's just telling them, "You are right, we are against you
" So obviously, this is creating in societies that are all multiethnic, multi-religious, multicultural, this is creating a situation in which, really, it is much easier for the propaganda of these terrorist organizations to be effective in recruiting people for terror acts within the countries where these kinds of sentences are expressed
 Undoubtedly
 In what sense?
 In the sense that, I mean, for many people the first reaction in relation to these kinds of terrorist attacks is: close all borders -- not understanding that the terrorist problem in Europe is largely homegrown
 We have thousands and thousands of European fighters in Syria and in Iraq, so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing Syrians to come in
 And I must say, I am convinced that the passport that appeared, I believe, was put by the person who has blown --
 -- himself up, yeah
 [I believe] it was on purpose, because part of the strategies of Daesh is against refugees, because they see refugees as people that should be with the caliphate and are fleeing to the crusaders
 And I think that is part of Daesh's strategy to make Europe react, closing its doors to Muslim refugees and having an hostility towards Muslims inside Europe, exactly to facilitate Daesh's work
And another thing that I believe is that to a large extent, what we are today paying for in Europe is the failures of integration models that didn't work in the '60s, in the '70s, in the '80s, in relation to big migration flows that took place at that time and generated what is today in many of the people, for instance, of the second generation of communities, a situation of feeling marginalized, having no jobs, having improper education, living in some of the neighborhoods that are not adequately provided by public infrastructure
 And this kind of uneasiness, sometimes even anger, that exists in this second generation is largely due to the failure of integration policies, to the failure of what should have been a much stronger investment in creating the conditions for people to live together and respect each other
 For me it is clear
For me it is clear that all societies will be multiethnic, multicultural, multi-religious in the future
 To try to avoid it is, in my opinion, impossible
 And for me it's a good thing that they will be like that, but I also recognize that, for that to work properly, you need a huge investment in the social cohesion of your own societies
 And Europe, to a large extent, failed in that investment in the past few decades
 Question: You are stepping down from your job at the end of the year, after 10 years
 If you look back at 2005, when you entered that office for the first time, what do you see?
 Well, look: In 2005, we were helping one million people go back home in safety and dignity, because conflicts had ended
 Last year, we helped 124,000
 In 2005, we had about 38 million people displaced by conflict in the world
 Today, we have more than 60 million
 Now, we see a multiplication of new conflicts and the old conflicts never died: Afghanistan, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo
 It is clear that the capacity of the international community to prevent conflicts and to timely solve them, is, unfortunately, much worse than what it was 10 years ago
 There are no clear power relations in the world, no global governance mechanisms that work, which means that we live in a situation where impunity and unpredictability tend to prevail, and that means that more and more people suffer, namely those that are displaced by conflicts
 It's a tradition in American politics that when a President leaves the Oval Office for the last time, he leaves a handwritten note on the desk for his successor that walks in a couple of hours later
 Well, I don't think I would write any message
 You know, one of the terrible things when one leaves an office is to try to become the backseat driver, always telling the new one what to do
 So that, I will not do
 If I had to say something to him, it would be, "Be yourself, and do your best
"
 Commissioner, thank you for the job you do
 Thank you for coming to TED
 Jane Fonda: Yes we have
 And one of the things that I read about female friendship is something that Cervantes said
" So let's start with --
 We're in big trouble
 Hand me one of those waters, I'm extremely dry
 We have a very limited --
 Just being with her sucks the life out of me
 You ain't seen nothing yet
 Anyway -- sorry
 I look for someone who has a sense of fun, who's audacious, who's forthcoming, who has politics, who has even a small scrap of passion for the planet, someone who's decent, has a sense of justice and who thinks I'm worthwhile
 I mean it's, "I have my friends, therefore I am
"
 
 No, it's true
 I exist because I have my women friends
 They -- You're one of them
 I don't know about you
 But anyway --
You know, they make me stronger, they make me smarter, they make me braver
 They tap me on the shoulder when I might be in need of course-correcting
 You know? I mean, it's nice -- LT: Thank you
 No, I do, I include you in that, because listen, you know -- it's nice to have somebody still around to play with and learn from when you're getting toward the end
 No, I'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me
 Well, as we grow older, and as we go through different kinds of life's journeys, what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive?
 Well you have to use a lot of --
 She doesn't invite me over much, I'll tell you that
 I have to use a lot of social media -- You be quiet now
 And so --
 And I look through my emails, I look through my texts to find my friends, so I can answer them as quickly as possible, because I know they need my counsel
They need my support, because most of my friends are writers, or activists, or actors, and you're all three 
 and a long string of other descriptive phrases, and I want to get to you as soon as possible, I want you to know that I'm there for you
 Do you do emojis?
 Oh 
 JF: No?
 That's embarrassing
 JF: I'm really into emojis
 No, I spell out my -- I spell out my words of happiness and congratulations, and sadness
 You spell it right out --
 I spell it, every letter
 Such a purist
 You know, as I've gotten older, I've understood more the importance of friendships, and so, I really make an effort to reach out and make play dates -- not let too much time go by
 And were you grateful? LT: I was grateful
 And --
 There's been very little research done on us, even though we volunteered lots of times
 That's for sure
 This is really exciting, and you all will be interested in this
 The Harvard Medical School study has shown that women who have close female friendships are less likely to develop impairments -- physical impairments as they age, and they are likely to be seen to be living much more vital, exciting --
 And longer --
 Joyful lives
 We live five years longer than men
 I think I'd trade the years for joy
 But the most important part is they found -- the results were so exciting and so conclusive -- the researchers found that not having close female friends is detrimental to your health, as much as smoking or being overweight
 And there's something else, too --
 I've said my part, so 
 OK, well, listen to my part, because there's an additional thing
 Because they only -- for years, decades -- they only researched men when they were trying to understand stress, only very recently have they researched what happens to women when we're stressed, and it turns out that when we're stressed -- women, our bodies get flooded by oxytocin
 And I do think that's one reason why we live longer
 And I feel so bad for men because they don't have that
 Testosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin
 Well, when you and I and Dolly made "9 to 5" 
 Oh --
 We laughed, we did, we laughed so much, we found we had so much in common and we're so different
 Here she is, like Hollywood royalty, I'm like a tough kid from Detroit, [Dolly's] a Southern kid from a poor town in Tennessee, and we found we were so in sync as women, and we must have -- we laughed -- we must have added at least a decade onto our lifespans
 I think -- we sure crossed our legs a lot
 You're adding decades to our lives right now
 So among the books that Jane sent us both to read on female friendship was one by a woman we admire greatly, Sister Joan Chittister, who said about female friendship that women friends are not just a social act, they're a spiritual act
 Do you think of your friends as spiritual? Do they add something spiritual to your lives?
 Spiritual -- I absolutely think that
 Because -- especially people you've known a long time, people you've spent time with -- I can see the spiritual essence inside them, the tenderness, the vulnerability
 There's actually kind of a love, an element of love in the relationship
 I just see deeply into your soul
 Do you think that, Jane --
 But I have special powers
 Well, there's all kinds of friends
 There's business friends, and party friends, I've got a lot of those
But the oxytocin-producing friendships have 
 They feel spiritual because it's a heart opening, right? You know, we go deep
 And -- I find that I shed tears a lot with my intimate friends
 Not because I'm sad but because I'm so touched and inspired by them
 And you know one of you is going to go soon
 Well, two of us are sitting here, Lily, which one are you talking about?
 And I always think, when women talk about their friendships, that men always look a little mystified
 There's a lot of difference, and I think we have to have a lot of empathy for men --
 Which I think may be why they die sooner
 They're revelatory
 I mean how many times have I asked you, "Am I doing OK?" "Did I really screw up there?"
 You're doing great
 But I mean, we ask questions like that of our women friends, and men don't
 You know, people describe women's relationships as face-to-face, whereas men's friendships are more side-by-side
 I mean most of the time men don't want to reveal their emotions, they want to bury deeper feelings
 I mean, that's the general, conventional thought
 I mean, it's just the kind of -- it's a more manly behavior
 You meant -- LT: They talk about sex
 I meant they might have sex if they could get somebody in their man cave to --
 You know something, though, that I find very interesting -- and again, psychologists didn't know this until relatively recently -- is that men are born every bit as relational as women are
 If you look at films of newborn baby boys and girls, you'll see the baby boys just like the girls, gazing into their mother's eyes, you know, needing that relational exchange of energy
 When the mother looks away, they could see the dismay on the child, even the boy would cry
 They need relationship
 So the question is why, as they grow older, does that change? And the answer is patriarchal culture, which says to boys and young men that to be needing of relationship, to be emotional with someone is girly
 That a real man doesn't ask directions or express a need, they don't go to doctors if they feel bad
 There's a quote that I really like, "Men fear that becoming 'we' will erase his 'I'
" You know, his sense of self
 Whereas women's sense of self has always been kind of porous
 But our "we" is our saving grace, it's what makes us strong
 It's not that we're better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove
 And, well --
 So we can express our humanity -- LT: I know who Gloria Steinem is
 I know you know who she is, but I think it's a --
No, but it's a great quote, I think
 We're not better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove
 And that's really important
 But men are so inculcated in the culture to be comfortable in the patriarchy
 Women's friendships are like a renewable source of power
 Well, that's what's exciting about this subject
 It is why we're talking about it, because women's friendships are, as you said, Jane, a renewable source of power
 So how do we use that power?
 Well, women are the fastest growing demographic in the world, especially older women
 And if we harness our power, we can change the world
 And guess what? We need to
 And one of the things that we need to do -- and we can do it as women -- for one thing, we kind of set the consumer standards
 We need to consume less
 We in the Western world need to consume less and when we buy things, we need to buy things that are made locally, when we buy food, we need to buy food that's grown locally
 We need to make ourselves independent from fossil fuels
 And the fossil fuel companies -- the Exxons and the Shell Oils and those bad guys -- cause they are -- are going to tell us that we can't do it without going back to the Stone Age
 There are countries in the world right now that are living mostly on renewable energy and doing just fine
 And they tell us that if we do wean ourselves from fossil fuel that we're going to be back in the Stone Age, and in fact, if we begin to use renewable energy, and not drill in the Arctic, and not drill --
 Oh, boy
 And not drill in the Alberta tar sands -- Right
 That we will be -- there will be more democracy and more jobs and more well-being, and it's women that are going to lead the way
 Maybe we have the momentum to start a third-wave feminist movement with our sisterhood around the world, with women we don't see, women we may never meet, but we join together that way, because -- Aristotle said -- most people -- people would die without male friendships
 And the operative word here was "male
" Because they thought that friendships should be between equals and women were not considered equal --
 They didn't think we had souls even, the Greeks
 No, exactly
 That shows you just how limited Aristotle was
 It's like, you know, men do need women now
 The US Constitution needs women
 You're talking about the Equal Rights Amendment
 Right
 Justice Ginsberg said something like -- every constitution that's been written since the end of World War II included a provision that made women citizens of equal stature, but ours does not
 So that would be a good place to start
 Very, very mild --
 Right
And gender equality, it's like a tide, it would lift all boats, not just women
 Needing new role models on how to do that
 How to be friends, how to think about our power in different ways, as consumers, as citizens of the world, and this is what makes Jane and Lily a role model of how women can be friends -- for a very long time, and even if they occasionally disagree
 Thanks
 Thank you
 Thank you
So, I have an overlooked but potentially lucrative investment opportunity for you
 Over the past 10 years in the UK, the return on burial plots has outperformed the UK property market by a ratio of around three to one
 And they're projected to achieve about 40 percent growth
 The biggest advantage is that this is a market with continuous demand
 I'm an architect and urban designer, and for the past year and a half, I've been looking at approaches to death and dying and at how they've shaped our cities and the buildings within them
So in the summer, I did my first exhibition on death and architecture in Venice, and it was called "Death in Venice
" And because death is a subject that many of us find quite uncomfortable to talk about, the exhibition was designed to be quite playful, so that people would literally engage with it
 So one of our exhibits was an interactive map of London which showed just how much of the real estate in the city is given over to death
 As you wave your hand across the map, the name of the piece of real estate -- the building or the cemetery -- is revealed
 In fact, the majority are cemeteries
So about half a million people die in the UK each year, and of those, around a quarter will want to be buried
 But the UK, like many Western European countries, is running out of burial space, especially in the major cities
 And the Greater London Authority has been aware of this for a while, and the main causes are population growth, the fact that existing cemeteries are almost full
 There's a custom in the UK that graves are considered to be occupied forever, and there's also development pressure -- people want to use that same land to build houses or offices or shops
So they came up with a few solutions
 They were like, well, maybe we can reuse those graves after 50 years
 Or maybe we can bury people, like, four deep, so that four people can be buried in the same plot, and we can make more efficient use of the land that way, and in that way, hopefully London will still have space to bury people in the near future
But, traditionally, cemeteries haven't been taken care of by the local authority
 In fact, the surprising thing is that there's no legal obligation on anyone in the UK to provide burial space
 But there's also occasionally been a for-profit group who has wanted to get in on the act
 And, you know, they look at the small size of a burial plot and that high cost, and it looks like there's serious money to be made
So, actually, if you want to go out and start your own cemetery, you kind of can
 There was this couple in South Wales, and they had a farmhouse and a load of fields next to it, and they wanted to develop the land
 They first thought about making a caravan park, but the council said no
 Then they hit on the idea of making a cemetery and they calculated that by doing this, they could increase the value of their land from about 95,000 pounds to over one million pounds
But just to come back to this idea of making profit from cemeteries, like, it's kind of ludicrous, right? The thing is that the high cost of those burial plots is actually very misleading
 They look like they're expensive, but that cost reflects the fact that you need to maintain the burial plot -- like, someone has to cut the grass for the next 50 years
 That means it's very difficult to make money from cemeteries
 And it's the reason that normally they're run by the council or by a not-for-profit group
 But anyway, the council granted these people permission, and they're now trying to build their cemetery
So just to explain to you kind of how this works: If I want to build something in the UK, like a cemetery for example, then I have to apply for planning permission first
 So if I want to build a new office building for a client or if I want to extend my home or, you know, if I have a shop and I want to convert it into an office, I have to do a load of drawings, and I submit them to the council for permission
 And they'll look at things like how it fits in the surroundings
 So they'll look at what it looks like
 But they'll also think about things like what impact is it going to have on the local environment? And they'll be thinking about things like, is this thing going to cause pollution or is there going to be a lot of traffic that wants to go to this thing that I've built? But also good things
 Is it going to add local services like shops to the neighborhood that local people would like to use? And they'll weigh up the advantages and the disadvantages and they'll make a decision
So that's how it works if I want to build a large cemetery
 So actually, if you want to go and make your own mini-cemetery, then you can
 But the really weird thing is that you don't need to have a piece of land of a certain size before you're allowed to start burying people on it
 And so that means that, technically, this applies to, like, the back garden of your house in the suburbs
So, the first thing that they tell you is that you need to have a certificate of burial before you can go ahead -- you're not allowed to just murder people and put them under the patio
They also tell you that you need to keep a record of where the grave is
 Now, they do warn you that your neighbors might not like this, but, legally speaking, there's almost nothing that they can do about it
 And just in case any of you still had that profit idea in your mind about how much those burial plots cost and how much money you might be able to make, they also warn that it might cause the value of your house to drop by 20 percent
 Although, actually, it's more likely that no one will want to buy your house at all after that
 And the reasons that people give 
 you know, they think that their death is far off or they think that they're going to make people uncomfortable by talking about it
 And you know, to a certain extent, there are other people out there who are taking care of things for us
 The government has all this regulation and bureaucracy around things like burying a death, for example, and there's people like funeral directors who devote their entire working lives to this issue
 But when it comes to our cities and thinking about how death fits in our cities, there's much less regulation and design and thought than we might imagine
So we're not thinking about this, but all of the people we imagine are thinking about it -- they're not taking care of it either
Thank you
We're at a tipping point in human history, a species poised between gaining the stars and losing the planet we call home
Even in just the past few years, we've greatly expanded our knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe
 NASA's Kepler mission has discovered thousands of potential planets around other stars, indicating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy
 Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes as well as their distance from their parent star
 Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and rocky, like the terrestrial planets in our own Solar System, and also how much light they receive from their parent sun
 In turn, this provides clues as to whether these planets that we discover might be habitable or not
But I'm not a climate scientist, I'm an astronomer
 I study planetary habitability as influenced by stars with the hopes of finding the places in the universe where we might discover life beyond our own planet
Now, as somebody who is deeply embedded in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth, the more you appreciate our own planet itself
Consider our neighbor, Mars
 Mars is small and rocky, and though it's a bit far from the Sun, it might be considered a potentially habitable world if found by a mission like Kepler
 Indeed, it's possible that Mars was habitable in the past, and in part, this is why we study Mars so much
 Orbiters like the MAVEN mission sample the Martian atmosphere, trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habitability
 Private spaceflight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tantalizing possibility of living our lives on Mars
But though these Martian vistas resemble the deserts of our own home world, places that are tied in our imagination to ideas about pioneering and frontiers, compared to Earth Mars is a pretty terrible place to live
 Consider the extent to which we have not colonized the deserts of our own planet, places that are lush by comparison with Mars
 Even in the driest, highest places on Earth, the air is sweet and thick with oxygen exhaled from thousands of miles away by our rainforests
I worry -- I worry that this excitement about colonizing Mars and other planets carries with it a long, dark shadow: the implication and belief by some that Mars will be there to save us from the self-inflicted destruction of the only truly habitable planet we know of, the Earth
 As much as I love interplanetary exploration, I deeply disagree with this idea
 There are many excellent reasons to go to Mars, but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity is like the captain of the Titanic telling you that the real party is happening later on the lifeboats
Thank you
But the goals of interplanetary exploration and planetary preservation are not opposed to one another
 No, they're in fact two sides of the same goal: to understand, preserve and improve life into the future
 The extreme environments of our own world are alien vistas
 If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces out of hostile, inhospitable spaces here on Earth, perhaps we can meet the needs of both preserving our own environment and moving beyond it
I leave you with a final thought experiment: Fermi's paradox
 Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked that, given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it, we should have found evidence for alien life by now
 So where are they? Well, one possible solution to Fermi's paradox is that, as civilizations become technologically advanced enough to consider living amongst the stars, they lose sight of how important it is to safeguard the home worlds that fostered that advancement to begin with
 It is hubris to believe that interplanetary colonization alone will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and interplanetary exploration can work together
If we truly believe in our ability to bend the hostile environments of Mars for human habitation, then we should be able to surmount the far easier task of preserving the habitability of the Earth
Thank you
 this was my team
I stunk at sports
 I didn't like to play them, I didn't like to watch them
 So this is what I did
 I went fishing
 And for all of my growing up I fished on the shores of Connecticut, and these are the creatures that I saw on a regular basis
 But after I grew up and went to college, and I came home in the early 90's, this is what I found
 My team had shrunk
 And as I sort of looked into that, from a very personal point of view as a fisherman, I started to kind of figure out, well, what was the rest of the world thinking about it?
First place I started to look was fish markets
 And when I went to fish markets, in spite of where I was -- whether I was in North Carolina, or Paris, or London, or wherever -- I kept seeing this weirdly repeating trope of four creatures, again and again -- on the menus, on ice -- shrimp, tuna, salmon and cod
 And I thought this was pretty strange, and as I looked at it, I was wondering, did anyone else notice this sort of shrinking of the market?
Well, when I looked into it, I realized that people didn't look at it as their team
 We did it before, 10,000 years ago, when we came out of our caves
 If you look at fire pits from 10,000 years ago, you'll see raccoons, you'll see, you know, wolves, you'll see all kinds of different creatures
 But if you telescope to the age of -- you know, 2,000 years ago, you'll see these four mammals: pigs, cows, sheep and goats
 It's true of birds, too
 You look at the menus in New York City restaurants 150 years ago, 200 years ago, you'll see snipe, woodcock, grouse, dozens of ducks, dozens of geese
 But how have we headed in this direction? Well 
 first it's a very, very new problem
 This is the way we've been fishing the oceans over the last 50 years
 World War II was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish
 All of the technology that we perfected during World War II -- sonar, lightweight polymers -- all these things were redirected towards fish
 And so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity, quadrupling in the course of time, from the end of World War II to the present time
 And right now that means we're taking between 80 and 90 million metric tons out of the sea every year
 That's the equivalent of the human weight of China taken out of the sea every year
 And it's no coincidence that I use China as the example because China is now the largest fishing nation in the world
Well, that's only half the story
 The other half of the story is this incredible boom in fish farming and aquaculture, which is now, only in the last year or two, starting to exceed the amount of wild fish that we produce
 So that if you add wild fish and farmed fish together, you get the equivalent of two Chinas created from the ocean each and every year
 And again, it's not a coincidence that I use China as the example, because China, in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish, is also the biggest farmer of fish
So let's look though at the four choices we are making right now
 The first one -- by far the most consumed seafood in America and in much of the West, is shrimp
 Shrimp in the wild -- as a wild product -- is a terrible product
 5, 10, 15 pounds of wild fish are regularly killed to bring one pound of shrimp to the market
 They're also incredibly fuel inefficient to bring to the market
So you can farm them, and people do farm them, and they farm them a lot in this very area
 Problem is 
 the place where you farm shrimp is in these wild habitats -- in mangrove forests
 Now look at those lovely roots coming down
 That rate of destruction has slowed, but we're still in a major mangrove deficit
The other thing that's going on here is a phenomenon that the filmmaker Mark Benjamin called "Grinding Nemo
 Because what's going on right now, we have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp, catching a huge amount of bycatch, that bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food
 And sometimes, many of these vessels -- manned by slaves -- are catching these so-called "trash fish," fish that we would love to see on a reef, grinding them up and turning them into shrimp feed -- an ecosystem literally eating itself and spitting out shrimp
 So tuna is this ultimate global fish
 These huge management areas have to be observed in order for tuna to be well managed
 Our own management area, called a Regional Fisheries Management Organization, is called ICCAT, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas
Well, we could also try to grow tuna but tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture
 Many people don't know this but tuna are warm-blooded
 They can heat their bodies 20 degrees above ambient temperature, they can swim at over 40 miles an hour
 So that pretty much eliminates all the advantages of farming a fish, right? A farmed fish is -- or a fish is cold-blooded, it doesn't move too much
 That's a great thing for growing protein
 But if you've got this crazy, wild creature that swims at 40 miles an hour and heats its blood -- not a great candidate for aquaculture
The next creature -- most consumed seafood in America and throughout the West -- is salmon
 This is my home state of Connecticut
 Connecticut used to be home to a lot of wild salmon
 But if you look at this map of Connecticut, every dot on that map is a dam
 There are over 3,000 dams in the state of Connecticut
 I often say this is why people in Connecticut are so uptight --
If somebody could just unblock Connecticut's chi, I feel that we could have an infinitely better world
 But I made this particular comment at a convention once of national parks officers, and this guy from North Carolina sidled up to me, he says, "You know, you oughtn't be so hard on your Connecticut, cause we here in North Carolina, we got 35,000 dams
 And there are dams everywhere, and these are precisely the things that stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds
So as a result, we've turned to aquaculture, and salmon is one the most successful, at least from a numbers point of view
 The industry has, to its credit, greatly improved
 They've gotten it below two to one, although it's a little bit of a cheat because if you look at the way aquaculture feed is produced, they're measuring pellets -- pounds of pellets per pound of salmon
 Those pellets are in turn reduced fish
 So the actual -- what's called the FIFO, the fish in and the fish out -- kind of hard to say
 But in any case, credit to the industry, it has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon
Problem is we've also gone crazy with the amount of salmon that we're producing
 Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet
 It's growing at something like seven percent per year
 And so even though we're doing less per fish to bring it to the market, we're still killing a lot of these little fish
 So we've got chickens and they're eating fish, but weirdly, we also have fish that are eating chickens
 Because the byproducts of chickens -- feathers, blood, bone -- get ground up and fed to fish
 Anyway --
All together, though, it results in a terrible mess
 What you're talking about is something between 20 and 30 million metric tons of wild creatures that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up
 That's the equivalent of a third of a China, or of an entire United States of humans that's taken out of the sea each and every year
The last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing
 It's what the industry calls "whitefish
" There are many fish that get cycled into this whitefish thing but the way to kind of tell the story, I think, is through that classic piece of American culinary innovation, the Filet-O-Fish sandwich
 And it started because a local franchise owner found that when he served his McDonald's on Friday, nobody came
 Because it was a Catholic community, they needed fish
 So he went to Ray Kroc and he said, "I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich, going to be made out of halibut
 But let's do this, let's have a bet
 Whosever sandwich sells more, that will be the winning sandwich
" Well, it's kind of sad for the ocean that the Hula Burger didn't win
 So he made his halibut sandwich
 Unfortunately though, the sandwich came in at 30 cents
 Ray wanted the sandwich to come in at 25 cents, so he turned to Atlantic cod
 We all know what happened to Atlantic cod in New England
So now the Filet-O-Fish sandwich is made out of Alaska pollock, it's the largest fin fish fishery in the United States, 2 to 3 billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year
 If we go through the pollock, the next choice is probably going to be tilapia
 Tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of 20 years ago
 It's actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein, and it's been a godsend to the third world
 The problem is that when you look about the West, it doesn't do what the West wants it to do
 It really doesn't have what's called an oily fish profile
 Well, one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised is could we eat them? Could we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon? There are arguments for it
 They are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market, a fraction of the fuel cost of say, shrimp, and at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale
 They also are omega-3 rich, a great source for EPA and DHA
 So that is a potential
 And if we were to go down that route what I would say is, instead of paying a few bucks a pound -- or a few bucks a ton, really -- and making it into aquafeed, could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen and make that our way of treating these particular fish?
Other possibility though, which is much more interesting, is looking at bivalves, particularly mussels
 Now, mussels are very high in EPA and DHA, they're similar to canned tuna
 They're also extremely fuel efficient
 To bring a pound of mussels to market is about a thirtieth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market
 They require no forage fish, they actually get their omega-3s by filtering the water of microalgae
 In fact, that's where omega-3s come from, they don't come from fish
Mussels and other bivalves do tremendous amounts of water filtration
 A single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day
 And this is incredibly important when we look at the world
 Right now, nitrification, overuse of phosphates in our waterways are causing tremendous algal blooms
 Over 400 new dead zones have been created in the last 20 years, tremendous sources of marine life death
We also could look at not a fish at all
 We could look at seaweed, the kelps, all these different varieties of things that can be high in omega-3s, can be high in proteins, tremendously good things
 They filter the water just like mussels do
 And weirdly enough, it turns out that you can actually feed this to cows
 Now, I'm not a big fan of cattle
 But if you wanted to keep growing cattle in a time and place where water resources are limited, you're growing seaweed in the water, you don't have to water it -- major consideration
And the last fish is a question mark
 We have the ability to create aquacultured fish that creates a net gain of marine protein for us
 This creature would have to be vegetarian, it would have to be fast growing, it would have to be adaptable to a changing climate and it would have to have that oily fish profile, that EPA, DHA, omega-3 fatty acid profile that we're looking for
This exists kind of on paper
 I have been reporting on these subjects for 15 years
 We can do it
 We've figured it all out
 We can produce a fish that's a net gain of marine protein and has omega-3s
" Great
 It doesn't seem to be getting scaled up
 If we do, 30 million metric tons of seafood, a third of the world catch, stays in the water
 We tend to go with our appetites rather than our minds
 But if we went with this, or some configuration of it, we might have a little more of this
 TEDYouth, make some noise!
 TEDYouth, make some --
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
 Get it pops, go ahead
 
 Pops, pops, pops, pops, pops, pops, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up! Oh my God
 Yeah, yeah, I remember
 That's when she was a little baby
 We would do something like this
 All right, pops, pops, pops, chill out, chill out
 Hold up, hold up, hold up
 Y'all remember the video
 This is like a little payback or something for 50 million people calling me the loser
 Hold up, hold up
 But a lot of people out there don't really know what beatboxing is, where it started from
 Right, right
 Where it came from
 So why don't you give them a little history -- just a tickle -- a bit of history of where it comes from
 Beatbox started here in New York
That's right, that's right
 New York, New York! Everybody like, "Yeah!" Well, we from St
 Louis
 Now you can put y'all hands down
 But beatbox started here in New York
 But because I don't have electricity coming out of me, we had to emulate what the beats was doing
 So when you would see the beatboxer, you would see us over to the side
 Then you would see a rapper, and when the rapper began to rap, we would do a simple beat, because back then the beats were simple --
or --
Those were simple beats
 But now, you got folks that want to do all type of stuff with their beats now, and they want to humiliate their father, which is not right when you want to humiliate the person that take care of you, pay all your tuition,  especially when you have 50 million people that just go around and call you "the loser
" Well, I'm taking that to heart
 But now we do something different in our house, so we have these jam sessions, and our jam sessions consist of us jamming in church
and we'll text the beat to each other
 Or we'll be in the kitchen cooking, road trips, airports
 Standing right there in the corner, "Aw, Dad -- listen to that
"
Naw, I'm kidding
 But you know what? We're talking all about this jam session and everything
 Yeah
 Why don't we give them a little peek, just a tiny bit of our jam session?
 Y'all want to hear some jam session? EC: Y'all ready for a jam session?
Yeah! Kick it, pops!
 I'm getting ready to go!
 Y'all ready? Everybody stand up! Come on, everybody stand up! Get on up! Come on, stretch!
 That's it
Thank you! Make some noise!
 Make some noise! Make some noise!
Thank you!
Can I get a show of hands -- how many of you in this room have been on a plane in this past year? That's pretty good
 Well, it turns out that you share that experience with more than three billion people every year
 And when we put so many people in all these metal tubes that fly all over the world, sometimes, things like this can happen and you get a disease epidemic
I first actually got into this topic when I heard about the Ebola outbreak last year
 And it turns out that, although Ebola spreads through these more range-limited, large-droplet routes, there's all these other sorts of diseases that can be spread in the airplane cabin
 So with H1N1, there was this guy that decided to go on the plane and in the matter of a single flight actually spread the disease to 17 other people
 And then there was this other guy with SARS, who managed to go on a three-hour flight and spread the disease to 22 other people
 That's not exactly my idea of a great superpower
When we take a look at this, what we also find is that it's very difficult to pre-screen for these diseases
 So when someone actually goes on a plane, they could be sick and they could actually be in this latency period in which they could actually have the disease but not exhibit any symptoms, and they could, in turn, spread the disease to many other people in the cabin
How that actually works is that right now we've got air coming in from the top of the cabin and from the side of the cabin, as you see in blue
 And then also, that air goes out through these very efficient filters that eliminate 99
 What happens right now, though, is that we have this mixing airflow pattern
 So if someone were to actually sneeze, that air would get swirled around multiple times before it even has a chance to go out through the filter
 So I thought: clearly, this is a pretty serious problem
I didn't have the money to go out and buy a plane, so I decided to build a computer instead
 It actually turns out that with computational fluid dynamics, what we're able to do is create these simulations that give us higher resolutions than actually physically going in and taking readings in the plane
 I take that and then I put it into this 3D-modeling software, really building that 3D model
 And then I divide that model that I just built into these tiny pieces, essentially meshing it so that the computer can better understand it
 And then I tell the computer where the air goes in and out of the cabin, throw in a bunch of physics and basically sit there and wait until the computer calculates the simulation
So what we get, actually, with the conventional cabin is this: you'll notice the middle person sneezing, and we go "Splat!" -- it goes right into people's faces
 It's pretty disgusting
 From the front, you'll notice those two passengers sitting next to the central passenger not exactly having a great time
 And when we take a look at that from the side, you'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the cabin
" So I actually conducted more than 32 different simulations and ultimately, I came up with this solution right here
 This is what I call a -- patent pending -- Global Inlet Director
 With this, we're able to reduce pathogen transmission by about 55 times, and increase fresh-air inhalation by about 190 percent
 So it's very cost-effective to install and we can do this directly overnight
 All we have to do is put a couple of screws in there and you're good to go
 And the results that we get are absolutely amazing
 Instead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns, we can create these walls of air that come down in-between the passengers to create personalized breathing zones
 And same thing from the side, you'll notice we're able to directly push those pathogens down
 So if you take a look again now at the same scenario but with this innovation installed, you'll notice the middle passenger sneezes, and this time, we're pushing that straight down into the outlet before it gets a chance to infect any other people
 So you'll notice the two passengers sitting next to the middle guy are breathing virtually no pathogens at all
 Take a look at that from the side as well, you see a very efficient system
And in short, with this system, we win
And so with this solution, what does this mean for the world? Well, when we take a look at this from the computer simulation into real life, we can see with this 3D model that I built over here, essentially using 3D printing, we can see those same airflow patterns coming down, right to the passengers
 In the past, the SARS epidemic actually cost the world about 40 billion dollars
 And in the future, a big disease outbreak could actually cost the world in excess of three trillion dollars
 So before, it used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service for one to two months, spend tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars to try to change something
So it's really now a matter of taking this through to certification, flight testing, and going through all of these regulatory approvals processes
 But it just really goes to show that sometimes the best solutions are the simplest solutions
 And two years ago, even, this project would not have happened, just because the technology then wouldn't have supported it
 But now with advanced computing and how developed our Internet is, it's really the golden era for innovation
And so the question I ask all of you today is: why wait? Together, we can build the future today
Thanks
In the past few months, I've been traveling for weeks at a time with only one suitcase of clothes
 So I looked through my suitcase and I couldn't find anything to wear
 I was lucky to be at the technology conference on that day, and I had access to 3D printers
 The next morning, I just took all the pieces, assembled them together in my hotel room, and this is actually the skirt that I'm wearing right now
So it wasn't the first time that I printed clothes
 For my senior collection at fashion design school, I decided to try and 3D print an entire fashion collection from my home
I always felt most creative when I worked from home
 I loved experimenting with new materials, and I always tried to develop new techniques to make the most unique textiles for my fashion projects
 I loved going to old factories and weird stores in search of leftovers of strange powders and weird materials, and then bring them home to experiment on
 As you can probably imagine, my roommates didn't like that at all
 I love the exact and the custom work I can do with all kinds of fashion technologies, like knitting machines and laser cutting and silk printing
One summer break, I came here to New York for an internship at a fashion house in Chinatown
 We worked on two incredible dresses that were 3D printed
 They were amazing -- like you can see here
 The models couldn't sit in them, and they even got scratched from the plastics under their arms
Later that year, a friend gave me a 3D printed necklace, printed using a home printer
 So I looked at the necklace, and then I thought, "If I can print a necklace from home, why not print my clothes from home, too?" I really liked the idea that I wouldn't have to go to the market and pick fabrics that someone else chose to sell -- I could just design them and print them directly from home
I found a small makerspace, where I learned everything I know about 3D printing
 Right away, they literally gave me the key to the lab, so I could experiment into the night, every night
The main challenge was to find the right filament for printing clothes with
 And I spent a month or so experimenting with PLA, which is a hard and scratchy, breakable material
The breakthrough came when I was introduced to Filaflex, which is a new kind of filament
 It's strong, yet very flexible
 And with it, I was able to print the first garment, the red jacket that had the word "Liberté" -- "freedom" in French -- embedded into it
 I chose this word because I felt so empowered and free when I could just design a garment from my home and then print it by myself
 And actually, you can easily download this jacket, and easily change the word to something else
So the printer plates are small, so I had to piece the garment together, just like a puzzle
And I wanted to solve another challenge
 I wanted to print textiles that I would use just like regular fabrics
 That's when I found an open-source file from an architect who designed a pattern that I love
 And with it, I was able to print a beautiful textile that I would use just like a regular fabric
 And it actually even looks a little bit like lace
So I took his file and I modified it, and changed it, played with it -- many kinds of versions out of it
 And I needed to print another 1,500 more hours to complete printing my collection
 So I brought six printers to my home and just printed 24-7
 And this is actually a really slow process, but let's remember the Internet was significantly slower 20 years ago, so 3D printing will also accelerate and in no time you'll be able to print a T-Shirt in your home in just a couple of hours, or even minutes
So you guys, you want to see what it looks like?
 Rebecca is wearing one of my five outfits
 Almost everything here she's wearing, I printed from my home
 Even her shoes are printed
 Wow!
 Thank you, Rebecca
  Thank you, guys
So I think in the future, materials will evolve, and they will look and feel like fabrics we know today, like cotton or silk
 Imagine personalized clothes that fit exactly to your measurements
Music was once a very physical thing
 You would have to go to the record shop and buy CDs, but now you can just download the music -- digital music -- directly to your phone
 Fashion is also a very physical thing
Thank you so much
[Thank You]
Great things happen at intersections
 There's freedom in that in-between, freedom to create from the indefiniteness of not-quite-here, not-quite-there, a new self-definition
 Some of the great intersections of the world come to mind, like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, or Times Square in New York City, both bustling with the excitement of a seemingly endless stream of people
 Other intersections, like the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court in Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind because of the tremendous energy at the intersection of human beings, ideologies and the ongoing struggle for justice
 Stars are born at the messy intersection of gas and dust, instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull
 Stars die by this same intersection, this time flung outward in a violent collision of smaller atoms, intersecting and efficiently fusing into altogether new and heavier things
 We can all think of intersections that have special meaning to us
 To be intersectional, then, is to occupy a position at an intersection
 I am both black and a woman
 Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies, this robust combination of knowing results in a shining example of the explosive fusion of identities
I have dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist since I was 12 years old
 I had no idea that at that time, according to Dr
 Jamie Alexander's archive of African-American women in physics, only 18 black women in the United States had ever earned a PhD in a physics-related discipline, and that the first black woman to graduate with a PhD in an astronomy-related field did so just one year before my birth
As I journeyed along my path, I encountered the best and worst of life at an intersection: the tremendous opportunity to self-define, the collision of expectation and experience, the exhilaration of victorious breakthroughs and, sometimes, the explosive pain of regeneration
 Our financial situation disintegrated just after my father's departure from our lives
 This thrust my mother, my sister and I out of the relative comfort of middle-class life and into the almost constant struggle to make ends meet
 Thus, I was one of roughly 60 percent of women of color who find finances to be a major barrier to their educational goals
 Thankfully, Norfolk State University provided me with full funding, and I was able to achieve my bachelor's in physics
After graduation, and despite knowing that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics, I fell through the cracks
 It was a poster that saved my dream, and some really incredible people and programs
 I remember thinking I was looking directly back at the little girl who first dared to dream this dream
 I described to them in the email my educational path, and my desire to find myself again in pursuit of the PhD
 They directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt University Bridge Program, itself an intersection of the master's and PhD degrees at two institutions
 After two years out of school, they accepted me into the program, and I found myself again on the path to the PhD
 Once I was physically occupying the space that would ultimately give way to my childhood aspirations, I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD
It became immediately apparent that not everyone was thrilled to have that degree of liminality in their space
 I was ostracized by many of my classmates, one of whom went so far as to invite me to "do what I really came here to do" as he pushed all the dirty dishes from our meal in front of me to clean up
 I wish that were an isolated occurrence, but for many women of color in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM, this is something they have long endured
 One hundred percent of the 60 women of color interviewed in a recent study by Joan C
 This mistaken identity was not reported by any of the white women interviewed for this study, which comprised 557 women in total
 While there is nothing inherently wrong with a janitorial position, and in fact my forefathers and foremothers were able to attend college because many of their parents worked these jobs, it was a clear attempt to put me in my place
While there was certainly the acute pain of the encounter, the real issue is that my appearance can tell anyone anything about my ability
 Beyond that, though, it underscores that the women of color in STEM do not experience the same set of barriers that just women or just people of color face
 That's why today I want to highlight women of color in STEM, who are inexorably, unapologetically living as the inseparable sum of identities
STEM itself is an intersectional term, such that its true richness cannot be appreciated without considering the liminal space between disciplines
 Science, the pursuit of understanding the physical world by way of chemistry, physics, biology, cannot be accomplished in the absence of mathematics
 Math itself serves the critical role of Rosetta Stone, decoding and encoding the physical principles of the world
 STEM is utterly incomplete without each individual piece
 This is to say nothing of the enrichment that is realized when STEM is combined with other disciplines
The purpose for this talk is twofold: first, to say directly to every black, Latina, indigenous, First Nation or any other woman or girl who finds herself resting at the blessed intersection of race and gender, that you can be anything you want to be
 My personal hope is that you'll become an astrophysicist, but beyond that, anything you want
 Do not think for one minute that because you are who you are, you cannot be who you imagine yourself to be
 Hold fast to those dreams and let them carry you into a world you can't even imagine
 We have as a global society solved most of the single-faceted issues of our time
 Those that remain require a thorough investigation of the liminal space between disciplines to create the multifaceted solutions of tomorrow
 Who better to solve these liminal problems than those who have faced their whole lives at the intersections
One of my favorite examples of liminal excellence comes from the late Dr
 Claudia Alexander, a black woman plasma physicist, who passed away this past July after a 10-year bout with breast cancer
 She was a NASA project scientist who spearheaded the NASA side of the Rosetta mission, which became famous this year for landing a rover on a comet, and the 1
5 billion dollar Galileo mission to Jupiter, two high-profile scientific victories for NASA, the United States and the world
 Dr
 For me, it's among the purposes of my life to take us from states of ignorance to states of understanding with bold exploration that you can't do every day
"
This shows exactly the power of a liminal person
 She had the technical ability to spearhead some of the most ambitious space missions of our time, and she perfectly understood her place of being exactly who she was in any place she was
Jessica Matthews, inventor of the SOCCKET line of sports products, like soccer balls, that generate renewable energy as you play with them, said it this way: "A major part of invention isn't just creating things, it's understanding people and understanding the systems that make this world
" The reason I tell my story and the story of Dr
Despite implicit and explicit questions of my right to be in an elite space, I'm proud to report that when I graduated, I was the first black woman to earn a PhD in astrophysics in Yale's then 312-year history
 This is to say nothing of the things we haven't even thought of yet
Women of color in STEM occupy some of the toughest and most exciting sociotechnological issues of our time
 Thus, we are uniquely positioned to contribute to and drive these conversations in ways that are more inclusive of a wider variety of lived experience
 This outlook can be expanded to the many intersectional people whose experiences, positive and negative, enrich the conversations in ways that outmatch even the best-resourced homogenous groups
This is not a request born out of a desire to fit in
 It's a reminder that we cannot get to the best possible outcomes for the totality of humanity without precisely this collaboration, this bringing together of the liminal, the differently lived, distinctly experienced and disparately impacted
 Simply put, we cannot be the most excellent expression of our collective genius without the full measure of humanity brought to bear

 A journey that takes place between two breaths -- the last one before diving into the water, and the first one, coming back to the surface
 That dive is a journey to the very limits of human possibility, a journey into the unknown
 But it's also, and above all, an inner journey, where a number of things happen, physiologically as well as mentally
 And that's why I'm here today, to share my journey with you and to take you along with me
 It ends with a special technique called the carp, which allows me to store one to two extra liters of air in my lungs by compressing it
 As soon as I leave the surface the first mechanism kicks in: the diving reflex
 My heart beat will drop from about 60-70 per minute to about 30-40 beats per minute in a matter of seconds; almost immediately
Next, the diving reflex causes peripheral vasoconstriction, which means that the blood flow will leave the body's extremities to feed the most important organs: the lungs, the heart and the brain
 I cannot control it
 If you go underwater, even if you've never done it before, you'll experience the exact same effects
 All human beings share this characteristic
 And what's extraordinary is that we share this instinct with marine mammals -- all marine mammals: dolphins, whales, sea lions, etc
 And, of course, it works much better for them
 It's absolutely fascinating
So as I dive deeper into the blue, the pressure slowly starts to squeeze my lungs
 And since it's the amount of air in my lungs that makes me float, the farther down I go, the more pressure there is on my lungs, the less air they contain and the easier it is for my body to fall
 And at one point, around 35 or 40 meters down, I don't even need to swim
 My body is dense and heavy enough to fall into the depths by itself, and I enter what's called the free fall phase
 It's the reason I still dive
 Because it feels like you're being pulled down and you don't need to do anything
 I let myself be pulled by the depths, and it feels like I'm flying underwater
And so I slowly continue sliding to the bottom
 My lungs reach residual volume, below which they're not supposed to be compressed, in theory
 And this second response is called blood shift, or "pulmonary erection" in French
 I prefer "blood shift
"
So blood shift -- how does it work? The capillaries in the lungs become engorged with blood -- which is caused by the suction -- so the lungs can harden and protect the whole chest cavity from being crushed
 It prevents the two walls of the lungs from collapsing, from sticking together and caving in
 Thanks to this phenomenon, which we also share with marine mammals, I'm able to continue with my dive
60, 70 meters down, I keep falling, faster and faster, because the pressure is crushing my body more and more
 Below 80 meters, the pressure becomes a lot stronger, and I start to feel it physically
 I really start to feel the suffocation
 You can see what it looks like -- not pretty at all
 The diaphragm is completely collapsed, the rib cage is squeezed in, and mentally, there is something going on as well
You may be thinking, "This doesn't look enjoyable
 How do you do it?" If I relied on my earthly reflexes -- what do we do above water when there's a problem? We resist, we go against it
 We fight
 Underwater, that doesn't work
 So what you need to do, mentally, is to tell yourself that nature and the elements are stronger than you
And so I let the water crush me
 I accept the pressure and go with it
 I relinquish all control, and relax completely
 The pressure starts crushing me, and it doesn't feel bad at all
 I even feel like I'm in a cocoon, protected
 80, 85 meters down, 90, 100
 100 meters -- the magic number
 In every sport, it's a magic number
 For swimmers and athletes and also for us, free divers, it's a number everyone dreams of
 Everyone wishes one day to be able to get to 100 meters
 And it's a symbolic number for us, because in the 1970s, doctors and physiologists did their math, and predicted that the human body would not be able to go below 100 meters
 Below that, they said, the human body would implode
 He even reached 105 meters
 At that time, he was doing "no limits
" He'd use weights to descend faster and come back up with a balloon, just like in the movie
 Today, we go down 200 meters in no limit free diving
 I can do 123 meters by simply using muscle strength
So I carry on with my dive
 105, 110, 115
 The bottom is getting closer
 120, 123 meters
 I'm at the bottom
And now, I'd like to ask you to join me and put yourself in my place
 Imagine you get to 123 meters
 You're alone
 The pressure is crushing you completely -- 13 times stronger than on the surface
 And I know what you're thinking: "This is horrible
 What the hell am I doing here? He's insane
" But no
 That's not what I think when I'm down there
 When I'm at the bottom, I feel good
 I get this extraordinary feeling of well-being
 Maybe it's because I've completely released all tensions and let myself go
 I feel great, without the need to breathe
 I feel like a tiny dot, a little drop of water, floating in the middle of the ocean
 [The Pale Blue Dot] It's that small dot the arrow is pointing to
 Do you know what it is? It's planet Earth
 Planet Earth, photographed by the Voyager probe, from 4 billion kilometers away
 And it shows that our home is that small dot over there, floating in the middle of nothing
That's how I feel when I'm at the bottom, at 123 meters
 I feel like a small dot, a speck of dust, stardust, floating in the middle of the cosmos, in the middle of nothing, in the immensity of space
 It's a fascinating sensation, because when I look up, down, left, right, in front, behind, I see the same thing: the infinite deep blue
 Nowhere else on Earth you can experience this -- looking all around you, and seeing the same thing
 And at that moment, I still get that feeling each time, building up inside of me -- the feeling of humility
Looking at this picture, I feel very humble -- just like when I'm all the way down at the bottom -- because I'm nothing, I'm a little speck of nothingness lost in all of time and space
 And it still is absolutely fascinating
 I decide to go back to the surface, because this is not where I belong
So I start heading back up
 I get something of a shock at the very moment when I decide to go up
 It pulled you down on the way in, and will do the same on the way up
 You have to swim twice as hard
 Then, I'm hit with another phenomenon known as narcosis
 I don't know if you've heard of that
 It's called nitrogen narcosis
 It's something that happens to scuba divers, but it can happen to free divers
 A flurry of thoughts goes spinning through your head
 The more you try to control it, the harder it is to manage
 Then, a third thing happens: the desire to breathe
 I'm not a fish, I'm a human being, and the desire to breathe reminds me of that fact
 And with everything else that's going on, you can very easily lose your ground and start to panic
 I want to breathe now
" You should not do that
 Never look up to the surface -- not with your eyes, or your mind
 You should never picture yourself up there
 You have to stay in the present
 And I focus on that, on the present moment
 Because if I think about the surface, I panic
 And if I panic, it's over
 deliverance
 I'm not alone any more
 The safety divers, my guardian angels, join me
 They leave the surface, we meet at 30 meters, and they escort me for the final few meters, where potential problems could arise
 Every time I see them, I think to myself, "It's thanks to you
" It's thanks to them, my team, that I'm here
 It brings back the sense of humility
 Without my team, without all the people around me, the adventure into the deep would be impossible
 A journey into the deep is above all a group effort
So I'm happy to finish my journey with them, because I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them
 20 meters, 10 meters, my lungs slowly return to their normal volume
 Buoyancy pushes me up to the surface
 And so I arrive at the surface
  Air floods into my lungs
 It's like being born again, a relief
 It feels good
 Though the journey was extraordinary, I do need to feel those small oxygen molecules fueling my body
 It's an extraordinary sensation, but at the same time it's traumatizing
 It's a shock to the system, as you can you imagine
 I go from complete darkness to the light of day, from the near-silence of the depths to the commotion up top
 In terms of touch, I go from the soft, velvety feeling of the water, to air rubbing across my face
 In terms of smell, there is air rushing into my lungs
 They were completely squashed just 90 seconds ago, and now, they've opened up again
 So all of this affects quite a lot of things
 I need a few seconds to come back, and to feel "all there" again
 But that needs to happen quickly, because the judges are there to verify my performance; I need to show them I'm in perfect physical condition
 You saw in the video, I was doing a so-called exit protocol
 Once at the surface, I have 15 seconds to take off my nose clip, give this signal and say  "I am OK
" Plus, you need to be bilingual
On top of everything -- that's not very nice
 Once the protocol is completed, the judges show me a white card, and that's when the joy starts
 I can finally celebrate what has just happened
 It's about being at ease in the water
 It's extremely beautiful, very poetic and artistic
So my wife and I decided to film it and try to show another side of it, mostly to make people want to go into the water
 Let me show you some images to finish my story
 It's a mix of beautiful underwater photos
 It calms your mind
Today, in the 21st century, we're under so much pressure
 Our minds are overworked, we think at a million miles an hour, we're always stressed
 It means being underwater, floating, with your body completely relaxed, letting go of all your tensions
 This is our plight in the 21st century: our backs hurt, our necks hurt, everything hurts, because we're stressed and tense all the time
 But when you're in the water, you let yourself float, as if you were in space
 You let yourself go completely
 It's an extraordinary feeling
 You can finally get in touch with your body, mind and spirit
 Everything feels better, all at once
Learning how to free dive is also about learning to breathe correctly
 Breathing gives rhythm to our lives
 Learning how to breathe better is learning how to live better
 You can see little fish, seaweed, the flora and fauna, you can watch it all discreetly, sliding underwater, looking around, and coming back to the surface, leaving no trace
 It's an amazing feeling to become one with nature like that
And if I may say one more thing, holding your breath, being in the water, finding this underwater world -- it's all about connecting with yourself
 You heard me talk a lot about the body's memory that dates back millions of years, to our marine origins
 The day you get back into the water, when you hold your breath for a few seconds, you will reconnect with those origins
 And I guarantee it's absolute magic
 I encourage you to try it out
Thank you
You might think there are many things that I can't do because I cannot see
 Actually, I just needed to have a bit of help to come up to the stage
But there is also a lot that I can do
 Actually, I love sports and I can play many sports, like swimming, skiing, skating, scuba diving, running and so on
 But there is one limitation: somebody needs to help me
 I want to be independent
 I was an active, independent teenager, and suddenly I became blind
 The hardest thing for me was losing my independence
 Things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone
 Back then, there were no personal computers, no Internet, no smartphones
 So I had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks, and I had to create my own books in Braille
 Can you imagine? Of course, my brothers were not happy about it, and later, I noticed they were not there whenever I needed them
 That became my strong desire to ignite innovation
Jump ahead to the mid-1980s
 I got to know cutting-edge technologies and I thought to myself, how come there is no computer technology to create books in Braille? These amazing technologies must be able to also help people with limitations like myself
 That's the moment my innovation journey began
I started developing digital book technologies, such as a digital Braille editor, digital Braille dictionary and a digital Braille library network
 This may not surprise you, since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in 2015
 But Braille went digital many years before digital books, already in the late 1980s, almost 30 years ago
 Strong and specific needs of the blind people made this opportunity to create digital books way back then
 The telephone was invented while developing a communication tool for hearing impaired people
Now I'm going to give you another example from my own life
 In the '90s, people around me started talking about the Internet and web browsing
 I remember the first time I went on the web
 I was astonished
 I could access newspapers at any time and every day
 I desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the Internet, and I found ways to render the web into synthesized voice, which dramatically simplified the user interface
This led me to develop the Home Page Reader in 1997, first in Japanese and later, translated into 11 languages
 When I developed the Home Page Reader, I got many comments from users
 One that I strongly remember said, "For me, the Internet is a small window to the world
"
It was a revolutionary moment for the blind
 The cyber world became accessible, and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses, way beyond what I imagined
 It can help drivers listen to their emails or it can help you listen to a recipe while cooking
Today, I am more independent, but it is still not enough
 For example, when I approached the stage just now, I needed assistance
 My goal is to come up here independently
 And not just here
 My goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you
 This is a smartphone app that we are working on
 51 feet to the door, and keep straight
 Take the two doors to go out
 Looks so happy
 Chieko Asakawa: Hi, Nick!
 Oh -- well, my paper just got accepted
 CA: That's great! Congratulations
 Thanks
 Wait -- how'd you know it was me, and that I look happy? 
 Hi
 hi
 He is not talking to you, but on his phone
 Potato chips
 Dark chocolate with almonds
 You gained 5 pounds since yesterday; take apple instead of chocolate
 Approaching
 You arrived
Thank you
So now the app navigates me by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors and permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments all by myself
 But the computer vision part that showed who is approaching, in which mood -- we are still working on that part
So now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me see the real world
 We call this cognitive assistance
 It understands our surrounding world and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration to my fingers
 Cognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities -- in other words, our five senses
 This technology is only in an early stage, but eventually, I'll be able to find a classroom on campus, enjoy window shopping or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street
 It will be amazing if I can find you on the street before you notice me
So, this really is a great challenge
 It is a challenge that needs collaboration, which is why we are creating an open community to accelerate research activities
 Just this morning, we announced the open-source fundamental technologies you just saw in the video
The frontier is the real world
 The blind community is exploring this technical frontier and the pathfinder
 I hope to work with you to explore the new era, and the next time that I'm on this stage, through technology and innovation, I will be able to walk up here all by myself
Thank you so much
What does a working mother look like? If you ask the Internet, this is what you'll be told
 Never mind that this is what you'll actually produce if you attempt to work at a computer with a baby on your lap
But no, this isn't a working mother
 You'll notice a theme in these photos
 We'll look at a lot of them
 That theme is amazing natural lighting, which, as we all know, is the hallmark of every American workplace
There are thousands of images like these
 Just put the term "working mother" into any Google image search engine, stock photo site
 They're all over the Internet, they're topping blog posts and news pieces, and I've become kind of obsessed with them and the lie that they tell us and the comfort that they give us, that when it comes to new working motherhood in America, everything's fine
But it's not fine
 That's a moral problem but today I'm also going to tell you why it's an economic problem
I got so annoyed and obsessed with the unreality of these images, which look nothing like my life, that I recently decided to shoot and star in a parody series of stock photos that I hoped the world would start to use just showing the really awkward reality of going back to work when your baby's food source is attached to your body
Nothing says "Give that girl a promotion" like leaking breast milk through your dress during a presentation
 You'll notice that there's no baby in this photo, because that's not how this works, not for most working mothers
Did you know, and this will ruin your day, that every time a toilet is flushed, its contents are aerosolized and they'll stay airborne for hours? And yet, for many new working mothers, this is the only place during the day that they can find to make food for their newborn babies
I put these things, a whole dozen of them, into the world
 I wanted to make a point
 I'm going to share 10 of their stories with you today
 They are totally real, some of them are very raw, and not one of them looks anything like this
Here's the first
 "I was an active duty service member at a federal prison
 I returned to work after the maximum allowed eight weeks for my C-section
 A male coworker was annoyed that I had been out on 'vacation,' so he intentionally opened the door on me while I was pumping breast milk and stood in the doorway with inmates in the hallway
"
Most of the stories that these women, total strangers, send to me now, are not actually even about breastfeeding
A woman wrote to me to say, "I gave birth to twins and went back to work after seven unpaid weeks
 Emotionally, I was a wreck
 Physically, I had a severe hemorrhage during labor, and major tearing, so I could barely get up, sit or walk
 My employer told me I wasn't allowed to use my available vacation days because it was budget season
"
 So we choose to look at, and believe, this image
 I don't really know what's going on in this picture, because I find it weird and slightly creepy
Like, what is she doing? But I know what it tells us
 It tells us that everything's fine
 This working mother, all working mothers and all of their babies, are fine
 There's nothing to see here
 And anyway, women have made a choice, so none of it's even our problem
 The first choice says that women have chosen to work
 So, that's not true
 Our paid work is a part, a huge part, of the engine of this economy, and it is essential for the engines of our families
 On a national level, our paid work is not optional
Choice number two says that women are choosing to have babies, so women alone should bear the consequences of those choices
 You know, that's one of those things that when you hear it in passing, can sound correct
 I certainly wasn't there when that happened
 But that stance ignores a fundamental truth, which is that our procreation on a national scale is not optional
 Our procreation on a national scale is not optional
 These aren't choices
 We need women to work
 We need working women to have babies
 So we should make doing those things at the same time at least palatable, right?
 88 percent of working mothers will not get one minute of paid leave after they have a baby
So now you're thinking about unpaid leave
 It exists in America
 It's called FMLA
 It does not work
 Because of the way it's structured, all kinds of exceptions, half of new mothers are ineligible for it
Here's what that looks like
 I had not been there long enough to qualify for FMLA, so I wasn't eligible for unpaid leave
 When I took time off to meet my newborn son, I lost my job
"
 Of those who do have access to just that unpaid leave, most women can't afford to take much of it at all
 We used up all of our tax returns and half of our savings during my six unpaid weeks
 We just couldn't manage any longer
 Physically it was hard, but emotionally it was worse
 I struggled for months being away from my son
"
So this decision to go back to work so early, it's a rational economic decision driven by family finances, but it's often physically horrific because putting a human into the world is messy
A waitress told me, "With my first baby, I was back at work five weeks postpartum
 With my second, I had to have major surgery after giving birth, so I waited until six weeks to go back
 I had third degree tears
"
23 percent of new working mothers in America will be back on the job within two weeks of giving birth
"I worked as a bartender and cook, average of 75 hours a week while pregnant
 I had to return to work before my baby was a month old, working 60 hours a week
 Childbirth is, and always will be, an enormous psychological event
A teacher told me, "I returned to work eight weeks after my son was born
 I already suffer from anxiety, but the panic attacks I had prior to returning to work were unbearable
"
Statistically speaking, the shorter a woman's leave after having a baby, the more likely she will be to suffer from postpartum mood disorders like depression and anxiety, and among many potential consequences of those disorders, suicide is the second most common cause of death in a woman's first year postpartum
Heads up that this next story -- I've never met this woman, but I find it hard to get through
"I feel tremendous grief and rage that I lost an essential, irreplaceable and formative time with my son
 Labor and delivery left me feeling absolutely broken
 For months, all I remember is the screaming: colic, they said
 On the inside, I was drowning
 Every morning, I asked myself how much longer I could do it
 I was allowed to bring my baby to work
 I closed my office door while I rocked and shushed and begged him to stop screaming so I wouldn't get in trouble
 I hid behind that office door every damn day and cried while he screamed
 I cried in the bathroom while I washed out the pump equipment
 Every day, I cried all the way to work and all the way home again
"
 What of the babies? As a country, do we care about the millions of babies born every year to working mothers? I say we don't, not until they're of working and tax-paying and military-serving age
 We tell them we'll see them in 18 years, and getting there is kind of on them
 One of the reasons I know this is that babies whose mothers have 12 or more weeks at home with them are more likely to get their vaccinations and their well checks in their first year, so those babies are more protected from deadly and disabling diseases
America has a message for new mothers who work and for their babies
 Whatever time you get together, you should be grateful for it, and you're an inconvenience to the economy and to your employers
 That narrative of gratitude runs through a lot of the stories I hear
A woman told me, "I went back at eight weeks after my C-section because my husband was out of work
 Without me, my daughter had failure to thrive
 She wouldn't take a bottle
 She started losing weight
 Thankfully, my manager was very understanding
 He let my mom bring my baby, who was on oxygen and a monitor, four times a shift so I could nurse her
There's a little club of countries in the world that offer no national paid leave to new mothers
 Care to guess who they are? The first eight make up eight million in total population
 They are Papua New Guinea, Suriname and the tiny island nations of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau and Tonga
 Number nine is the United States of America, with 320 million people
 Oh, that's it
 That's the end of the list
 Every other economy on the planet has found a way to make some level of national paid leave work for the people doing the work of the future of those countries, but we say, "We couldn't possibly do that
" We say that the market will solve this problem, and then we cheer when corporations offer even more paid leave to the women who are already the highest-educated and highest-paid among us
 Remember that 88 percent? Those middle- and low-income women are not going to participate in that
 We know that there are staggering economic, financial, physical and emotional costs to this approach
 We have decided -- decided, not an accident, to pass these costs directly on to working mothers and their babies
 We know the price tag is higher for low-income women, therefore disproportionately for women of color
 We pass them on anyway
All of this is to America's shame
 But it's also to America's risk
 Because what would happen if all of these individual so-called choices to have babies started to turn into individual choices not to have babies
One woman told me, "New motherhood is hard
 It shouldn't be traumatic
 When we talk about expanding our family now, we focus on how much time I would have to care for myself and a new baby
"
The birthrate needed in America to keep the population stable is 2
1 live births per woman
 In America today, we are at 1
 We need women to have babies, and we are actively disincentivizing working women from doing that
 What would happen to work force, to innovation, to GDP, if one by one, the working mothers of this country were to decide that they can't bear to do this thing more than once?
 It is long since time for the most powerful country on Earth to offer national paid leave to the people doing the work of the future of this country and to the babies who represent that future
 Childbirth is a public good
 This leave should be state-subsidized
 It should have no exceptions for small businesses, length of employment or entrepreneurs
 It should be able to be shared between partners
 I've talked today a lot about mothers, but co-parents matter on so many levels
Not one more woman should have to go back to work while she is hobbling and bleeding
 Not one more family should have to drain their savings account to buy a few days of rest and recovery and bonding
 Not one more fragile infant should have to go directly from the incubator to day care because his parents have used up all of their meager time sitting in the NICU
 Not one more working family should be told that the collision of their work, their needed work and their needed parenthood, is their problem alone
The catch is that when this is happening to a new family, it is consuming, and a family with a new baby is more financially vulnerable than they've ever been before, so that new mother cannot afford to speak up on her own behalf
 But all of us have voices
 It should not matter
 This is an American issue
We need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us
 We need to stop being comforted by them
 Because this is not, this is not, and this is not what a working mother looks like
 These jobs are also done by the plants, the animals and the ecosystems on our planet, including the ecosystems I study: the tropical coral reefs
 Coral reefs are farmers
 They provide food, income and food security for hundreds of millions of people around the world
 Coral reefs are security guards
 The structures that they build protect our shorelines from storm surge and waves, and the biological systems that they house filter the water and make it safer for us to work and play
 Coral reefs are chemists
 And coral reefs are artists
 The structures that they build are some of the most beautiful things on planet Earth
 And this beauty is the foundation of the tourism industry in many countries with few or little other natural resources
So for all of these reasons, all of these ecosystem services, economists estimate the value of the world's coral reefs in the hundreds of billions of dollars per year
 And yet despite all that hard work being done for us and all that wealth that we gain, we have done almost everything we possibly could to destroy that
 We have taken the fish out of the oceans and we have added in fertilizer, sewage, diseases, oil, pollution, sediments
 We have trampled the reefs physically with our boats, our fins, our bulldozers, and we have changed the chemistry of the entire sea, warmed the waters and made storms worse
 And these would all be bad on their own, but these threats magnify each other and compound one another and make each other worse
I'll give you an example
 Where I live and work, in Curaçao, a tropical storm went by a few years ago
 And on the eastern end of the island, where the reefs are intact and thriving, you could barely tell a tropical storm had passed
 But in town, where corals had died from overfishing, from pollution, the tropical storm picked up the dead corals and used them as bludgeons to kill the corals that were left
 This is a coral that I studied during my PhD -- I got to know it quite well
 This magnification of threats, this compounding of factors is what Jeremy Jackson describes as the "slippery slope to slime
" It's hardly even a metaphor because many of our reefs now are literally bacteria and algae and slime
Now, this is the part of the talk where you may expect me to launch into my plea for us to all save the coral reefs
 But I have a confession to make: that phrase drives me nuts
 And yet, almost everyone I meet, no matter how educated, is not sure what a coral is or where they come from
 How would we get someone to care about the world's coral reefs when it's an abstract thing they can barely understand? If they don't understand what a coral is or where it comes from, or how funny or interesting or beautiful it is, why would we expect them to care about saving them?
 What is a coral and where does it come from? Corals are born in a number of different ways, but most often by mass spawning: all of the individuals of a single species on one night a year, releasing all the eggs they've made that year into the water column, packaged into bundles with sperm cells
 And those bundles go to the surface of the ocean and break apart
 And hopefully -- hopefully -- at the surface of the ocean, they meet the eggs and sperm from other corals
 And that is why you need lots of corals on a coral reef -- so that all of their eggs can meet their match at the surface
 When they're fertilized, they do what any other animal egg does: divides in half again and again and again
 Taking these photos under the microscope every year is one of my favorite and most magical moments of the year
 They can sense color and light, textures, chemicals, pH
 They can even feel pressure waves; they can hear sound
 And they use those talents to search the bottom of the reef for a place to attach and live the rest of their lives
So imagine finding a place where you would live the rest of your life when you were just two days old
 They attach in the place they find most suitable, they build a skeleton underneath themselves, they build a mouth and tentacles, and then they begin the difficult work of building the world's coral reefs
 One coral polyp will divide itself again and again and again, leaving a limestone skeleton underneath itself and growing up toward the sun
 Given hundreds of years and many species, what you get is a massive limestone structure that can be seen from space in many cases, covered by a thin skin of these hardworking animals
 Now, there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet, maybe 1,000
 But these systems house millions and millions of other species, and that diversity is what stabilizes the systems, and it's where we're finding our new medicines
 It's how we find new sources of food
 I'm lucky enough to work on the island of Curaçao, where we still have reefs that look like this
 But, indeed, much of the Caribbean and much of our world is much more like this
Scientists have studied in increasing detail the loss of the world's coral reefs, and they have documented with increasing certainty the causes
 But in my research, I'm not interested in looking backward
 My colleagues and I in Curaçao are interested in looking forward at what might be
 And we have the tiniest reason to be optimistic
 Because even in some of these reefs that we probably could have written off long ago, we sometimes see baby corals arrive and survive anyway
 And we're starting to think that baby corals may have the ability to adjust to some of the conditions that the adults couldn't
 They may be able to adjust ever so slightly more readily to this human planet
 So in the research I do with my colleagues in Curaçao, we try to figure out what a baby coral needs in that critical early stage, what it's looking for and how we can try to help it through that process
 I'm going to show you three examples of the work we've done to try to answer those questions
A few years ago we took a 3D printer and we made coral choice surveys -- different colors and different textures, and we simply asked the coral where they preferred to settle
 And we found that corals, even without the biology involved, still prefer white and pink, the colors of a healthy reef
 And they prefer crevices and grooves and holes, where they will be safe from being trampled or eaten by a predator
 So we can use this knowledge, we can go back and say we need to restore those factors -- that pink, that white, those crevices, those hard surfaces -- in our conservation projects
 We can also use that knowledge if we're going to put something underwater, like a sea wall or a pier
 We can choose to use the materials and colors and textures that might bias the system back toward those corals
 Now in addition to the surfaces, we also study the chemical and microbial signals that attract corals to reefs
 Starting about six years ago, I began culturing bacteria from surfaces where corals had settled
 And I tried those one by one by one, looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach
 And we now have many bacterial strains in our freezer that will reliably cause corals to go through that settlement and attachment process
 So as we speak, my colleagues in Curaçao are testing those bacteria to see if they'll help us raise more coral settlers in the lab, and to see if those coral settlers will survive better when we put them back underwater
Now in addition to these tools, we also try to uncover the mysteries of species that are under-studied
 This is one of my favorite corals, and always has been: dendrogyra cylindrus, the pillar coral
 I love it because it makes this ridiculous shape, because its tentacles are fat and look fuzzy and because it's rare
 Finding one of these on a reef is a treat
 In fact, it's so rare, that last year it was listed as a threatened species on the endangered species list
 And this was in part because in over 30 years of research surveys, scientists had never found a baby pillar coral
 We weren't even sure if they could still reproduce, or if they were still reproducing
So four years ago, we started following these at night and watching to see if we could figure out when they spawn in Curaçao
 We got some good tips from our colleagues in Florida, who had seen one in 2007, one in 2008, and eventually we figured out when they spawn in Curaçao and we caught it
 And here's a male on the right, releasing sperm
 Thanks to the work of our scientific aunts and uncles, and thanks to the 10 years of practice we've had in Curaçao at raising other coral species, we got some of those larvae to go through the rest of the process and settle and attach, and turn into metamorphosed corals
 So this is the first pillar coral baby that anyone ever saw
And I have to say -- if you think baby pandas are cute, this is cuter
So we're starting to figure out the secrets to this process, the secrets of coral reproduction and how we might help them
 And this is true all around the world; scientists are figuring out new ways to handle their embryos, to get them to settle, maybe even figuring out the methods to preserve them at low temperatures, so that we can preserve their genetic diversity and work with them more often
 But this is still so low-tech
Now, compare that to our other crises and our other areas of concern as a society
 We have advanced medical technology, we have defense technology, we have scientific technology, we even have advanced technology for art
 But our technology for conservation is behind
 Think back to the most difficult job you ever did
 Many of you would say it was being a parent
 My mother described being a parent as something that makes your life far more amazing and far more difficult than you could've ever possibly imagined
 I've been trying to help corals become parents for over 10 years now
 And watching the wonder of life has certainly filled me with amazement to the core of my soul
 But I've also seen how difficult it is for them to become parents
 The pillar corals spawned again two weeks ago, and we collected their eggs and brought them back to the lab
 They'll be infected with bacteria, they will explode and those bacteria will threaten the life of this one embryo that has a chance
 We don't know if it was our handling methods that went wrong and we don't know if it was just this coral on this reef, always suffering from low fertility
 Whatever the cause, we have much more work to do before we can use baby corals to grow or fix or, yes, maybe save coral reefs
 They're providing us with art and food and medicine
 And we almost took out an entire generation of corals
 But a few made it anyway, despite our best efforts, and now it's time for us to thank them for the work they did and give them every chance they have to raise the coral reefs of the future, their coral babies
Now
 let's go back in time
 It's 1974
 There is the gallery somewhere in the world, and there is a young girl, age 23, standing in the middle of the space
 In the front of her is a table
 On the table there are 76 objects for pleasure and for pain
 Some of the objects are a glass of water, a coat, a shoe, a rose
 But also the knife, the razor blade, the hammer and the pistol with one bullet
 There are instructions which say, "I'm an object
 You can use everything on the table on me
 I'm taking all responsibility -- even killing me
 And the time is six hours
"
 People would give me the glass of water to drink, they'd give me the rose
 Somebody took the razor blade and cut my neck and drank the blood, and I still have the scar
 They carried me around and put me on the table, and put the knife between my legs
 And somebody took the pistol and bullet and put it against my temple
 And another person took the pistol and they started a fight
And after six hours were finished, I
 I was half-naked, I was full of blood and tears were running down my face
 And everybody escaped, they just ran away
 They could not confront myself, with myself as a normal human being
 And then -- what happened is I went to the hotel, it was at two in the morning
 And I looked at myself in the mirror, and I had a piece of gray hair
 Alright -- please take off your blindfolds
Welcome to the performance world
 First of all, let's explain what the performance is
 So many artists, so many different explanations, but my explanation for performance is very simple
 Performance is a mental and physical construction that the performer makes in a specific time in a space in front of an audience and then energy dialogue happens
 And the difference between performance and theater is huge
 In the performance, the blood is the material, and the razor blade or knife is the tool
 It's all about being there in the real time, and you can't rehearse performance, because you can't do many of these types of things twice -- ever
 Which is very important, the performance is -- you know, all human beings are always afraid of very simple things
 We're afraid of suffering, we're afraid of pain, we're afraid of mortality
 So what I'm doing -- I'm staging these kinds of fears in front of the audience
 I'm using your energy, and with this energy I can go and push my body as far as I can
 And then I liberate myself from these fears
 And I'm your mirror
 If I can do this for myself, you can do it for you
After Belgrade, where I was born, I went to Amsterdam
 And you know, I've been doing performances since the last 40 years
 And we made, for 12 years, performances together
 So to do this kind work you have to trust the person completely because this arrow is pointing to my heart
 And as every relationship comes to an end, ours went too
 We didn't make phone calls like normal human beings do and say, you know, "This is over
" We walked the Great Wall of China to say goodbye
 I started at the Yellow Sea, and he started from the Gobi Desert
 It was the mountains, it was difficult
 It was climbing, it was ruins
 It was, you know, going through the 12 Chinese provinces, this was before China was open in '87
 And we succeeded to meet in the middle to say goodbye
 And then our relationship stopped
And now, it completely changed how I see the public
 And one very important piece I made in those days was "Balkan Baroque
" And this was the time of the Balkan Wars, and I wanted to create some very strong, charismatic image, something that could serve for any war at any time, because the Balkan Wars are now finished, but there's always some war, somewhere
 So here I am washing two and a half thousand dead, big, bloody cow bones
 You can't wash the blood, you never can wash shame off the wars
 So I'm washing this six hours, six days, and wars are coming off these bones, and becoming possible -- an unbearable smell
 But then something stays in the memory
I want to show you the one who really changed my life, and this was the performance in MoMa, which I just recently made
 This performance -- when I said to the curator, "I'm just going to sit at the chair, and there will be an empty chair at the front, and anybody from the public can come and sit as long as they want
"
 And I sit everyday, eight hours -- the opening of the museum -- and 10 hours on Friday when the museum is open 10 hours, and I never move
 And I removed the table and I'm still sitting, and this changed everything
 But the need of people to actually experience something different, the public was not anymore the group -- relation was one to one
 I was watching these people, they would come and sit in front of me, but they would have to wait for hours and hours and hours to get to this position, and finally, they sit
And what happened? They are observed by the other people, they're photographed, they're filmed by the camera, they're observed by me and they have nowhere to escape except in themselves
 And that makes a difference
 There was so much pain and loneliness, there's so much incredible things when you look in somebody else's eyes, because in the gaze with that total stranger, that you never even say one word -- everything happened
 And I understood when I stood up from that chair after three months, I am not the same anymore
 And I understood that I have a very strong mission, that I have to communicate this experience to everybody
And this is how, for me, was born the idea to have an institute of immaterial performing arts
 It's not like a painting
 You have the painting on the wall, the next day it's there
 Performance, if you are missing it, you only have the memory, or the story of somebody else telling you, but you actually missed the whole thing
 So you have to be there
 And in my point, if you talk about immaterial art, music is the highest -- absolutely highest art of all, because it's the most immaterial
 That's my subjective way
This institute is going to happen in Hudson, upstate New York, and we are trying to build with Rem Koolhaas, an idea
 And it's very simple
 You have to sign the contract before you enter the building, that you will spend there a full six hours, you have to give me your word of honor
 It's something so old-fashioned, but if you don't respect your own word of honor and you leave before -- that's not my problem
 And then after you finish, you get a certificate of accomplishment, so get home and frame it if you want
 The public comes in, and the first thing you have to do is dress in lab coats
 And then you go to the lockers and you put your watch, your iPhone, your iPod, your computer and everything digital, electronic
 And you are getting free time for yourself for the first time
 Because there is nothing wrong with technology, our approach to technology is wrong
 We are losing the time we have for ourselves
 This is an institute to actually give you back this time
So what you do here, first you start slow walking, you start slowing down
 You're going back to simplicity
 After slow walking, you're going to learn how to drink water -- very simple, drinking water for maybe half an hour
 Then after this, you go to crystal chamber
 After crystal chamber, you go to eye-gazing chamber, after eye-gazing chamber, you go to a chamber where you are lying down
 So it's the three basic positions of the human body, sitting, standing and lying
 And slow walking
 And there is a sound chamber
 And then after you've seen all of this, and prepared yourself mentally and physically, then you are ready to see something with a long duration, like in immaterial art
 It can be music, it can be opera, it can be a theater piece, it can be film, it can be video dance
 You go to the long duration chairs because now you are comfortable
 In the long duration chairs, you're transported to the big place where you're going to see the work
 And if you fall asleep, which is very possible because it's been a long day, you're going to be transported to the parking lot
And you know, sleeping is very important
 In sleeping, you're still receiving art
 So in the parking lot you stay for a certain amount of time, and then after this you just, you know, go back, you see more of the things you like to see or go home with your certificate
So this institute right now is virtual
 Right now, I am just making my institute in Brazil, then it's going to be in Australia, then it's coming here, to Canada and everywhere
 And this is to experience a kind of simple method, how you go back to simplicity in your own life
 Counting rice will be another thing
You know, if you count rice you can make life, too
 How to count rice for six hours? It's incredibly important
 You know, you go through this whole range of being bored, being angry, being completely frustrated, not finishing the amount of rice you're counting
 Or having the sound-isolated situation -- that you have headphones, that you don't hear anything, and you're just there together without sound, with the people experiencing silence, just the simple silence
We are always doing things we like in our life
 And this is why you're not changing
 You do things in life -- it's just nothing happens if you always do things the same way
 But my method is to do things I'm afraid of, the things I fear, the things I don't know, to go to territory that nobody's ever been
And then also to include the failure
 If you don't go into that area and you don't fail, you are actually repeating yourself over and over again
 And I think that human beings right now need a change, and the only change to be made is a personal level change
 You have to make the change on yourself
 Because the only way to change consciousness and to change the world around us, is to start with yourself
 It's so easy to criticize how it's different, the things in the world and they're not right, and the governments are corrupted and there's hunger in the world and there's wars -- the killing
 But what we do on the personal level -- what is our contribution to this whole thing?
Can you turn to your neighbor, the one you don't know, and look at them for two full minutes in their eyes, right now?
I'm asking two minutes of your time, that's so little
 Breathe slowly, don't try to blink, don't be self-conscious
 Be relaxed
 Thank you for trusting me
 Thank you
 Thank you so much
Your company launches a search for an open position
 Now the choosing begins
 All the right stuff
 Person B: state school, fair amount of job hopping, and odd jobs like cashier and singing waitress
 But remember -- both are qualified
My colleagues and I created very official terms to describe two distinct categories of candidates
 You just heard a human resources director refer to people as Silver Spoons and Scrappers --
which is not exactly politically correct and sounds a bit judgmental
 But before my human resources certification gets revoked --
let me explain
 And over the years, I've learned something about people whose experiences read like a patchwork quilt, that makes me stop and fully consider them before tossing their resumes away
 A series of odd jobs may indicate inconsistency, lack of focus, unpredictability
 Or it may signal a committed struggle against obstacles
 At the very least, the Scrapper deserves an interview
 But if your whole life has been engineered toward success, how will you handle the tough times? One person I hired felt that because he attended an elite university, there were certain assignments that were beneath him, like temporarily doing manual labor to better understand an operation
 Eventually, he quit
 But on the flip side, what happens when your whole life is destined for failure and you actually succeed?
I want to urge you to interview the Scrapper
 I know a lot about this because I am a Scrapper
 Before I was born, my father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and he couldn't hold a job in spite of his brilliance
 Our lives were one part "Cuckoo's Nest," one part "Awakenings" and one part "A Beautiful Mind
"
I'm the fourth of five children raised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York
 We never owned a home, a car, a washing machine, and for most of my childhood, we didn't even have a telephone
 So I was highly motivated to understand the relationship between business success and Scrappers, because my life could easily have turned out very differently
 As I met successful business people and read profiles of high-powered leaders, I noticed some commonality
Many of them had experienced early hardships, anywhere from poverty, abandonment, death of a parent while young, to learning disabilities, alcoholism and violence
 The conventional thinking has been that trauma leads to distress, and there's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction
 But during studies of dysfunction, data revealed an unexpected insight: that even the worst circumstances can result in growth and transformation
In one study designed to measure the effects of adversity on children at risk, among a subset of 698 children who experienced the most severe and extreme conditions, fully one-third grew up to lead healthy, successful and productive lives
 In spite of everything and against tremendous odds, they succeeded
 One-third
Take this resume
 This guy's parents give him up for adoption
 He never finishes college
 He job-hops quite a bit, goes on a sojourn to India for a year, and to top it off, he has dyslexia
 Would you hire this guy? His name is Steve Jobs
In a study of the world's most highly successful entrepreneurs, it turns out a disproportionate number have dyslexia
 In the US, 35 percent of the entrepreneurs studied had dyslexia
 What's remarkable -- among those entrepreneurs who experience post traumatic growth, they now view their learning disability as a desirable difficulty which provided them an advantage because they became better listeners and paid greater attention to detail
 They don't think they are who they are in spite of adversity, they know they are who they are because of adversity
 They embrace their trauma and hardships as key elements of who they've become, and know that without those experiences, they might not have developed the muscle and grit required to become successful
One of my colleagues had his life completely upended as a result of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1966
 At age 13, his parents were relocated to the countryside, the schools were closed and he was left alone in Beijing to fend for himself until 16, when he got a job in a clothing factory
 But instead of accepting his fate, he made a resolution that he would continue his formal education
 Eleven years later, when the political landscape changed, he heard about a highly selective university admissions test
 He had three months to learn the entire curriculum of middle and high school
 He did it, he succeeded
 His commitment to his education was unwavering, and he never lost hope
 Today, he holds a master's degree, and his daughters each have degrees from Cornell and Harvard
Scrappers are propelled by the belief that the only person you have full control over is yourself
 When things don't turn out well, Scrappers ask, "What can I do differently to create a better result?" Scrappers have a sense of purpose that prevents them from giving up on themselves, kind of like if you've survived poverty, a crazy father and several muggings, you figure, "Business challenges? --
Really? Piece of cake
 I got this
And that reminds me -- humor
 Scrappers know that humor gets you through the tough times, and laughter helps you change your perspective
And finally, there are relationships
 People who overcome adversity don't do it alone
 Somewhere along the way, they find people who bring out the best in them and who are invested in their success
 Having someone you can count on no matter what is essential to overcoming adversity
 I was lucky
 In my first job after college, I didn't have a car, so I carpooled across two bridges with a woman who was the president's assistant
 She watched me work and encouraged me to focus on my future and not dwell on my past
 Along the way I've met many people who've provided me brutally honest feedback, advice and mentorship
 These people don't mind that I once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college
I'll leave you with one final, valuable insight
 Companies that are committed to diversity and inclusive practices tend to support Scrappers and outperform their peers
 According to DiversityInc, a study of their top 50 companies for diversity outperformed the S&P 500 by 25 percent
Hire the Scrapper
It's often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what's on their bookshelves
 What do my bookshelves say about me? Well, when I asked myself this question a few years ago, I made an alarming discovery
 I'd always thought of myself as a fairly cultured, cosmopolitan sort of person
 But my bookshelves told a rather different story
 Pretty much all the titles on them were by British or North American authors, and there was almost nothing in translation
 Discovering this massive, cultural blind spot in my reading came as quite a shock
And when I thought about it, it seemed like a real shame
 I knew there had to be lots of amazing stories out there by writers working in languages other than English
 And it seemed really sad to think that my reading habits meant I would probably never encounter them
 So, I decided to prescribe myself an intensive course of global reading
 2012 was set to be a very international year for the UK; it was the year of the London Olympics
 And it was very exciting and I learned some remarkable things and made some wonderful connections that I want to share with you today
But it started with some practical problems
 After I'd worked out which of the many different lists of countries in the world to use for my project, I ended up going with the list of UN-recognized nations, to which I added Taiwan, which gave me a total of 196 countries
 And after I'd worked out how to fit reading and blogging about, roughly, four books a week around working five days a week,
5 percent of the literary works published each year in the UK are translations, and the figures are similar for much of the English-speaking world
 Although, the proportion of translated books published in many other countries is a lot higher
 4
5 percent is tiny enough to start with, but what that figure doesn't tell you is that many of those books will come from countries with strong publishing networks and lots of industry professionals primed to go out and sell those titles to English-language publishers
 So, for example, although well over 100 books are translated from French and published in the UK each year, most of them will come from countries like France or Switzerland
 French-speaking Africa, on the other hand, will rarely ever get a look-in
The upshot is that there are actually quite a lot of nations that may have little or even no commercially available literature in English
 Their books remain invisible to readers of the world's most published language
 But when it came to reading the world, the biggest challenge of all for me was that fact that I didn't know where to start
 I couldn't tell you how to source a story from Swaziland
 I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia
 There was no hiding it -- I was a clueless literary xenophobe
 So how on earth was I going to read the world?
I was going to have to ask for help
 So in October 2011, I registered my blog, ayearofreadingtheworld
com, and I posted a short appeal online
 Now, I had no idea whether anyone would be interested, but within a few hours of me posting that appeal online, people started to get in touch
 Then it was friends of friends
 And pretty soon, it was strangers
Four days after I put that appeal online, I got a message from a woman called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur
 She said she loved the sound of my project, could she go to her local English-language bookshop and choose my Malaysian book and post it to me? I accepted enthusiastically, and a few weeks later, a package arrived containing not one, but two books -- Rafidah's choice from Malaysia, and a book from Singapore that she had also picked out for me
 Now, at the time, I was amazed that a stranger more than 6,000 miles away would go to such lengths to help someone she would probably never meet
 Time and again, people went out of their way to help me
 Some took on research on my behalf, and others made detours on holidays and business trips to go to bookshops for me
 It turns out, if you want to read the world, if you want to encounter it with an open mind, the world will help you
 When it came to countries with little or no commercially available literature in English, people went further still
Books often came from surprising sources
 My Panamanian read, for example, came through a conversation I had with the Panama Canal on Twitter
 Yes, the Panama Canal has a Twitter account
 And when I tweeted at it about my project, it suggested that I might like to try and get hold of the work of the Panamanian author Juan David Morgan
 I found Morgan's website and I sent him a message, asking if any of his Spanish-language novels had been translated into English
 And he said that nothing had been published, but he did have an unpublished translation of his novel "The Golden Horse
" He emailed this to me, allowing me to become one of the first people ever to read that book in English
Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith to share his work with me in this way
 I met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones
And I read about an orgy in a tree in Angola
But perhaps the most amazing example of the lengths that people were prepared to go to to help me read the world, came towards the end of my quest, when I tried to get hold of a book from the tiny, Portuguese-speaking African island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe
 Now, having spent several months trying everything I could think of to find a book that had been translated into English from the nation, it seemed as though the only option left to me was to see if I could get something translated for me from scratch
 Now, I was really dubious whether anyone was going to want to help with this, and give up their time for something like that
 Here's one of them
 And I sent a copy out to each of my volunteers
 They all took on a couple of short stories from this collection, stuck to their word, sent their translations back to me, and within six weeks, I had the entire book to read
In that case, as I found so often during my year of reading the world, my not knowing and being open about my limitations had become a big opportunity
 When it came to São Tomé and Príncipe, it was a chance not only to learn something new and discover a new collection of stories, but also to bring together a group of people and facilitate a joint creative endeavor
 My weakness had become the project's strength
The books I read that year opened my eyes to many things
 As those who enjoy reading will know, books have an extraordinary power to take you out of yourself and into someone else's mindset, so that, for a while at least, you look at the world through different eyes
 But it can also be really enlightening
 Wrestling with unfamiliar ideas can help clarify your own thinking
When I looked back at much of the English-language literature I'd grown up with, for example, I began to see how narrow a lot of it was, compared to the richness that the world has to offer
 And as the pages turned, something else started to happen, too
 Little by little, that long list of countries that I'd started the year with, changed from a rather dry, academic register of place names into living, breathing entities
Now, I don't want to suggest that it's at all possible to get a rounded picture of a country simply by reading one book
 But cumulatively, the stories I read that year made me more alive than ever before to the richness, diversity and complexity of our remarkable planet
 It was as though the world's stories and the people who'd gone to such lengths to help me read them had made it real to me
 These days, when I look at my bookshelves or consider the works on my e-reader, they tell a rather different story
 It's the tale of the potential human beings have to work together
And, it's testament to the extraordinary times we live in, where, thanks to the Internet, it's easier than ever before for a stranger to share a story, a worldview, a book with someone she may never meet, on the other side of the planet
 And I hope many more people will join me
 If we all read more widely, there'd be more incentive for publishers to translate more books, and we would all be richer for that
Thank you
There's something about caves -- a shadowy opening in a limestone cliff that draws you in
 As you pass through the portal between light and dark, you enter a subterranean world -- a place of perpetual gloom, of earthy smells, of hushed silence
Long ago in Europe, ancient people also entered these underground worlds
 As witness to their passage, they left behind mysterious engravings and paintings, like this panel of humans, triangles and zigzags from Ojo Guareña in Spain
 You now walk the same path as these early artists
When I'm in a cave, I often find myself wondering what drove these people to go so deep to brave dangerous and narrow passageways to leave their mark? In this video clip, that was shot half a kilometer, or about a third of a mile, underground, in the cave of Cudon in Spain, we found a series of red paintings on a ceiling in a previously unexplored section of the cave
 As we crawled forward, military-style, with the ceiling getting ever lower, we finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low that my husband and project photographer, Dylan, could no longer achieve focus on the ceiling with his DSLR camera
 So while he filmed me, I kept following the trail of red paint with a single light and a point-and-shoot camera that we kept for that type of occasion
 Half a kilometer underground
Seriously
 What was somebody doing down there with a torch or a stone lamp?
I mean -- me, it makes sense, right?
But you know, this is the kind of question that I'm trying to answer with my research
 I study some of the oldest art in the world
 It was created by these early artists in Europe, between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago
 And the thing is that I'm not just studying it because it's beautiful, though some of it certainly is
 While all species communicate in one way or another, only we humans have really taken it to another level
 Our desire and ability to share and collaborate has been a huge part of our success story
 The thing is, though, that we've been building on the mental achievements of those that came before us for so long that it's easy to forget that certain abilities haven't already existed
 It's one of the things I find most fascinating about studying our deep history
 Those people didn't have the shoulders of any giants to stand on
 They were the original shoulders
There are three main types of communication, spoken, gestural -- so things like sign language -- and graphic communication
 Spoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral
 It requires close contact for a message to be sent and received
 And after the moment of transmission, it's gone forever
 Graphic communication, on the other hand, decouples that relationship
Europe is one of the first places that we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing in caves, rock shelters and even a few surviving open-air sites
 But this is not the Europe we know today
 This was a world dominated by towering ice sheets, three to four kilometers high, with sweeping grass plains and frozen tundra
 This was the Ice Age
 They provide us with a rare glimpse into the creative world and imagination of these early artists
Since their discovery, it's been the animals that have received the majority of the study like this black horse from Cullalvera in Spain, or this unusual purple bison from La Pasiega
 But for me, it was the abstract shapes, what we call geometric signs, that drew me to study the art
 The funny this is that at most sites the geometric signs far outnumber the animal and human images
 But when I started on this back in 2007, there wasn't even a definitive list of how many shapes there were, nor was there a strong sense of whether the same ones appeared across space or time
 The problem was that while they were well documented at some sites, usually the ones with the very nice animals, there was also a large number of them where it was very vague -- there wasn't a lot of description or detail
 Some of them hadn't been visited in half a century or more
 These were the ones that I targeted for my field work
Over the course of two years, my faithful husband Dylan and I each spent over 300 hours underground, hiking, crawling and wriggling around 52 sites in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily
 And it was totally worth it
 We found new, undocumented geometric signs at 75 percent of the sites we visited
 This is the level of accuracy I knew I was going to need if I wanted to start answering those larger questions
So let's get to those answers
 Barring a handful of outliers, there are only 32 geometric signs
 Only 32 signs across a 30,000-year time span and the entire continent of Europe
 That is a very small number
 But 65 percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period -- things like lines, rectangles triangles, ovals and circles like we see here from the end of the Ice Age, at a 10,000-year-old site high in the Pyrenees Mountains
 And while certain signs span thousands of kilometers, other signs had much more restricted distribution patterns, with some being limited to a single territory, like we see here with these divided rectangles that are only found in northern Spain, and which some researchers have speculated could be some sort of family or clan signs
On a side note, there is surprising degree of similarity in the earliest rock art found all the way from France and Spain to Indonesia and Australia
 With many of the same signs appearing in such far-flung places, especially in that 30,000 to 40,000-year range, it's starting to seem increasingly likely that this invention actually traces back to a common point of origin in Africa
 But that I'm afraid, is a subject for a future talk
So back to the matter at hand
 There could be no doubt that these signs were meaningful to their creators, like these 25,000-year-old bas-relief sculptures from La Roque de Venasque in France
 The repetition of the same signs, for so long, and at so many sites tells us that the artists were making intentional choices
 If we're talking about geometric shapes, with specific, culturally recognized, agreed-upon meanings, than we could very well be looking at one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world
 There's just not enough characters at this point to have represented all of the words in the spoken language, something which is a requirement for a full writing system
 Nor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough to suggest that they were some sort of alphabet
 But what we do have are some intriguing one-offs, like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain, known as "The Inscription," with its symmetrical markings on the left, possible stylized representations of hands in the middle, and what looks a bit like a bracket on the right
The oldest systems of graphic communication in the world -- Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, the earliest Chinese script, all emerged between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago, with each coming into existence from an earlier protosystem made up of counting marks and pictographic representations, where the meaning and the image were the same
 So a picture of a bird would really have represented that animal
 It's only later that we start to see these pictographs become more stylized, until they almost become unrecognizable and that we also start to see more symbols being invented to represent all those other missing words in language -- things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives
So knowing all this, it seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe were truly abstract written characters
 Instead, what's much more likely is that these early artists were also making counting marks, maybe like this row of lines from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily, as well as creating stylized representations of things from the world around them
 Could some of the signs be weaponry or housing? Or what about celestial objects like star constellations? Or maybe even rivers, mountains, trees -- landscape features, possibly like this black penniform surrounded by strange bell-shaped signs from the site of El Castillo in Spain
 The term penniform means "feather-shaped" in Latin, but could this actually be a depiction of a plant or a tree? Some researchers have begun to ask these questions about certain signs at specific sites, but I believe the time has come to revisit this category as a whole
 The irony in all of this, of course, is that having just carefully classified all of the signs into a single category, I have a feeling that my next step will involve breaking it back apart as different types of imagery are identified and separated off
Now don't get me wrong, the later creation of fully developed writing was an impressive feat in its own right
 But it's important to remember that those early writing systems didn't come out of a vacuum
Thank you
Have you ever wondered what animals think and feel? Let's start with a question: Does my dog really love me, or does she just want a treat? Well, it's easy to see that our dog really loves us, easy to see, right, what's going on in that fuzzy little head
 What is going on? Something's going on
 Who are you?
 But is that true? What are other beings doing with those brains? What are they thinking and feeling? Is there a way to know? I think there is a way in
 We can look at evolution, we can look at their brains and we can watch what they do
 The first neurons came from jellyfish
 The vertebrates came out of the sea, and here we are
 What does that say about the minds of crayfish? Can we tell anything about that? Well, it turns out that if you give a crayfish a lot of little tiny electric shocks every time it tries to come out of its burrow, it will develop anxiety
 If you give the crayfish the same drug used to treat anxiety disorder in humans, it relaxes and comes out and explores
 How do we show how much we care about crayfish anxiety? Mostly, we boil them
 How do we celebrate the ape-like intelligence of this invertebrate? Mostly boiled
 If a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral, it will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping and it will signal to the moray, "Follow me," and the moray will understand that signal
 The moray may go into the crevice and get the fish, but the fish may bolt and the grouper may get it
 This is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about
 How do we celebrate that ancient partnership? Mostly fried
 A pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us than it does about them
Sea otters use tools and they take time away from what they're doing to show their babies what to do, which is called teaching
 Chimpanzees don't teach
 Killer whales teach and killer whales share food
When evolution makes something new, it uses the parts it has in stock, off the shelf, before it fabricates a new twist
 And our brain has come to us through the enormity of the deep sweep of time
But, uh oh, there's a dolphin, a bigger brain with more convolutions
 OK, maybe you're saying, all right, well, we see brains, but what does that have to say about minds? Well, we can see the working of the mind in the logic of behaviors
 So these elephants, you can see, obviously, they are resting
 They have found a patch of shade under the palm trees under which to let their babies sleep, while they doze but remain vigilant
 We make perfect sense of that image just as they make perfect sense of what they're doing because under the arc of the same sun on the same plains, listening to the howls of the same dangers, they became who they are and we became who we are
We've been neighbors for a very long time
 No one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed
 But if you record the voices of herders who carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations at water holes, the elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker
 Not only do elephants know that there are humans, they know that there are different kinds of humans, and that some are OK and some are dangerous
They have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them
 They know us better than we know them
 We have the same imperatives: take care of our babies, find food, try to stay alive
 The elephant has the same skeleton, the killer whale has the same skeleton, as do we
 We see helping where help is needed
 We see curiosity in the young
 We see the bonds of family connections
 We recognize affection
 Courtship is courtship
 And then we ask, "Are they conscious?"
When you get general anesthesia, it makes you unconscious, which means you have no sensation of anything
 Consciousness is simply the thing that feels like something
 If you see, if you hear, if you feel, if you're aware of anything, you are conscious, and they are conscious
Some people say well, there are certain things that make humans humans, and one of those things is empathy
 It's a very useful thing
 If your companions start to move quickly, you have to feel like you need to hurry up
 We're all in a hurry now
 The oldest form of empathy is contagious fear
 If your companions suddenly startle and fly away, it does not work very well for you to say, "Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left
"
 So there's basic empathy: you feel sad, it makes me sad
 I see you happy, it makes me happy
 I don't feel that same grief, but I get it; I know what you feel and it concerns me
"
And then if we're motivated to act on sympathy, I call that compassion
Far from being the thing that makes us human, human empathy is far from perfect
 We round up empathic creatures, we kill them and we eat them
 Now, maybe you say OK, well, those are different species
 That's just predation, and humans are predators
 People who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior know that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions to other species
 Well, I think that's silly, because attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species is the best first guess about what they're doing and how they're feeling, because their brains are basically the same as ours
 They have the same structures
 The same hormones that create mood and motivation in us are in those brains as well
 It is not scientific to say that they are hungry when they're hunting and they're tired when their tongues are hanging out, and then say when they're playing with their children and acting joyful and happy, we have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything
 That is not scientific
So OK, so a reporter said to me, "Maybe, but how do you really know that other animals can think and feel?" And I started to rifle through all the hundreds of scientific references that I put in my book and I realized that the answer was right in the room with me
 I know that I can go over to Carl, he will understand what I'm asking
 I know I can trust him because we're family
"
She has thought and she has felt, and it's really not more complicated than that
That tall-finned male is L41
 He's 38 years old
 The female right on his left side is L22
 She's 44
 They've known each other for decades
 They know exactly who they are
 They know who their friends are
 They know who their rivals are
 Their life follows the arc of a career
 They know where they are all the time
This is an elephant named Philo
 He was a young male
 Humans not only can feel grief, we create an awful lot of it
 We want to carve their teeth
 Why can't we wait for them to die? Elephants once ranged from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope
 In 1980, there were vast strongholds of elephant range in Central and Eastern Africa
 This is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction, a fellow being, the most magnificent creature on land
Of course, we take much better care of our wildlife in the United States
 We killed every single wolf south of the Canadian border, actually
 And then people came
 People came by the thousands to see the wolves, the most accessibly visible wolves in the world
 It has some breeding adults and the young of several generations
 And I watched the most famous, most stable pack in Yellowstone National Park
 The rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry
 Sisters kicked out other sisters
 That one on the left tried for days to rejoin her family
 They wouldn't let her because they were jealous of her
 She was getting too much attention from two new males, and she was the precocious one
 That was too much for them
 She wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot
 As winter was coming in, he lost his territory, his hunting support, the members of his family and his mate
 The mystery is, why don't they hurt us more than they do? This whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale with his companions who had killed that whale
 Those people in the boat had nothing at all to fear
 This whale is T20
 He had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions
 The seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat
 They had nothing to fear
 They eat seals
 Why don't they eat us? Why can we trust them around our toddlers? Why is it that killer whales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog and led them miles until the fog parted and the researchers' home was right there on the shoreline? And that's happened more than one time
In the Bahamas, there's a woman named Denise Herzing, and she studies spotted dolphins and they know her
 She knows them very well
 She knows who they all are
 They know her
 They recognize the research boat
 When she shows up, it's a big happy reunion
 Except, one time showed up and they didn't want to come near the boat, and that was really strange
 And they couldn't figure out what was going on until somebody came out on deck and announced that one of the people onboard had died during a nap in his bunk
 How could dolphins know that one of the human hearts had just stopped? Why would they care? And why would it spook them? These mysterious things just hint at all of the things that are going on in the minds that are with us on Earth that we almost never think about at all
At an aquarium in South Africa was a little baby bottle-nosed dolphin named Dolly
 She was nursing, and one day a keeper took a cigarette break and he was looking into the window into their pool, smoking
 Dolly came over and looked at him, went back to her mother, nursed for a minute or two, came back to the window and released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like smoke
 Somehow, this baby bottle-nosed dolphin got the idea of using milk to represent smoke
The things that make us human are not the things that we think make us human
 What makes us human is that, of all these things that our minds and their minds have, we are the most extreme
 We are the most compassionate, most violent, most creative and most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet, and we are all of those things all jumbled up together
 It's not special to us
 We are not the only ones who care about our mates
 We are not the only ones who care about our children
Albatrosses frequently fly six, sometimes ten thousand miles over several weeks to deliver one meal, one big meal, to their chick who is waiting for them
 They nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world, and this is what it looks like
 Passing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being
 If anything is sacred, that is, and into that sacred relationship comes our plastic trash
 All of these birds have plastic in them now
This is not the relationship we are supposed to have with the rest of the world
 But we, who have named ourselves after our brains, never think about the consequences
 When we welcome new human life into the world, we welcome our babies into the company of other creatures
 We don't paint cell phones
 We don't paint work cubicles
 We paint animals to show them that we are not alone
 We have company
So we started with a question: Do they love us? We're going to ask another question
 Are we capable of using what we have to care enough to simply let them continue?
Thank you very much
 Perhaps we could start by just telling us about your country
 It's three dots there on the globe
 Those dots are pretty huge
 I think each one is about the size of California
 Tell us about Kiribati
 Well, let me first begin by saying how deeply grateful I am for this opportunity to share my story with people who do care
 I think I've been sharing my story with a lot of people who don't care too much
 But Kiribati is comprised of three groups of islands: the Gilbert Group on the west, we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle, and the Line Islands in the east
 And quite frankly, Kiribati is perhaps the only country that is actually in the four corners of the world, because we are in the Northern Hemisphere, in the Southern Hemisphere, and also in the east and the west of the International Date Line
 These islands are entirely made up of coral atolls, and on average about two meters above sea level
 And so this is what we have
 And so, on many occasions, I've been asked by people, "You know, you're suffering, why don't you move back?" They don't understand
 They have no concept of what it is that's involved
" And so this is what I tell them
 If we move back, we will fall off on the other side of the ocean
 OK? But these are the kinds of issues that people don't understand
 When was it that you yourself realized that there might be impending peril for your country?
 Well, the story of climate change has been one that has been going on for quite a number of decades
 And when I came into office in 2003, I began talking about climate change at the United Nations General Assembly, but not with so much passion, because then there was still this controversy among the scientists whether it was human-induced, whether it was real or it wasn't
 But I think that that debate was fairly much concluded in 2007 with the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC, which made a categorical statement that it is real, it's human-induced, and it's predicting some very serious scenarios for countries like mine
 And so that's when I got very serious
 In the past, I talked about it
 We were worried
 But when the scenarios, the predictions came in 2007, it became a real issue for us
 Now, those predictions are, I think, that by 2100, sea levels are forecast to rise perhaps three feet
 There's scenarios where it's higher than that, for sure, but what would you say to a skeptic who said, "What's three feet? You're on average six feet above sea level
 What's the problem?"
 Well, I think it's got to be understood that a marginal rise in sea level would mean a loss of a lot of land, because much of the land is low
 And quite apart from that, we are getting the swells at the moment
 So it's not about getting two feet
 Well, we're at the very bottom end of the spectrum
 It's already with us
 We have communities who already have been dislocated
 They have had to move, and every parliament session, I'm getting complaints from different communities asking for assistance to build seawalls, to see what we can do about the freshwater lens because it's being destroyed, and so in my trips to the different islands, I'm seeing evidence of communities which are now having to cope with the loss of food crops, the contamination of the water lenses, and I see these communities perhaps leaving, having to relocate, within five to 10 years
 Well, we're on the equator, and I'm sure many of you understand that when you're on the equator, it's supposed to be in the doldrums
 We're not supposed to get the cyclones
 But for the first time, at the beginning of this year, the Cyclone Pam, which destroyed Vanuatu, and in the process, the very edges of it actually touched our two southernmost islands, and all of Tuvalu was underwater when Hurricane Pam struck
 But for our two southernmost islands, we had waves come over half the island, and so this has never happened before
 And I've just come back from my own constituency, and I've seen these beautiful trees which had been there for decades, they've been totally destroyed
 So this is what's happening, but when we talk about the rising sea level, we think it's something that happens gradually
 It comes with the winds, it comes with the swells, and so they can be magnified, but what we are beginning to witness is the change in the weather pattern, which is perhaps the more urgent challenge that we will face sooner than perhaps the rising sea level
 So the country is already seeing effects now
 As you look forward, what are your options as a country, as a nation?
 I think I visit a number of -- I've been traveling the world to try and get people to understand
 And on one occasion, I think I spoke in Geneva and there was a gentleman who was interviewing me on something like this, and I said, "We are looking at floating islands," and he thought it was funny, but somebody said, "No, this is not funny
" And so I have been looking at floating islands
But, as a country, we have made a commitment that no matter what happens, we will try as much as possible to stay and continue to exist as a nation
 What that will take, it's going to be something quite significant, very, very substantial
 Either we live on floating islands, or we have to build up the islands to continue to stay out of the water as the sea level rises and as the storms get more severe
 But even that, it's going to be very, very difficult to get the kind of resourcing that we would need
 And then the only recourse is some form of forced migration
 Well, we are also looking at that because in the event that nothing comes forward from the international community, we are preparing, we don't want to be caught like what's happening in Europe
 OK? We don't want to mass migrate at some point in time
 We want to be able to give the people the choice today, those who choose and want to do that, to migrate
 Well, there's forced migration in your country's past, and I think just this week, just yesterday or the day before yesterday, you visited these people
 What happened here? What's the story here?
 Yes, and I'm sorry, I think somebody was asking why we were sneaking off to visit that place
 I had a very good reason, because we have a community of Kiribati people living in that part of the Solomon Islands, but these were people who were relocated from the Phoenix Islands, in fact, in the 1960s
 And so yesterday it was very interesting to meet with these people
 They didn't know who I was
 They hadn't heard of me
 Some of them later recognized me, but I think they were very happy
 Later they really wanted to have the opportunity to welcome me formally
 But I think what I saw yesterday was very interesting because here I see our people
 I spoke in our language, and of course they spoke back, they replied, but their accent, they are beginning not to be able to speak Kiribati properly
 I saw them, there was this lady with red teeth
 She was chewing betel nuts, and it's not something we do in Kiribati
 We don't chew betel nuts
 I met also a family who have married the local people here, and so this is what is happening
 As you go into another community, there are bound to be changes
 There is bound to be a certain loss of identity, and this is what we will be looking for in the future if and when we do migrate
 It must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day because of these questions about identity, the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost
 And it's very inspiring to hear you say you're going to fight to the end to try to preserve the nation in a location
 This is our wish
 Nobody wants ever to leave their home, and so it's been a very difficult decision for me
 As a leader, you don't make plans to leave your island, your home, and so I've been asked on a number of occasions, "So how do you feel?" And it doesn't feel good at all
 It's an emotional thing, and I've tried to live with it, and I know that on occasions, I'm accused of not trying to solve the problem because I can't solve the problem
 It's something that's got to be done collectively
Climate change is a global phenomenon, and as I've often argued, unfortunately, the countries, when we come to the United Nations -- I was in a meeting with the Pacific Island Forum countries where Australia and New Zealand are also members, and we had an argument
 There was a bit of a story in the news because they were arguing that to cut emissions, it would be something that they're unable to do because it would affect the industries
 And so here I was saying, OK, I hear you, I understand what you're saying, but try also to understand what I'm saying because if you do not cut your emissions, then our survival is on the line
 And so it's a matter for you to weigh this, these moral issues
 It's about industry as opposed to the survival of a people
 You know, I ask you yesterday what made you angry, and you said, "I don't get angry
" But then you paused
 I think this made you angry
 I'd refer you to my earlier statement at the United Nations
 There was a sense of futility that we are fighting a fight that we have no hope of winning
 I had to change my approach
 I had to become more reasonable because I thought people would listen to somebody who was rational, but I remain radically rational, whatever that is
 Now, a core part of your nation's identity is fishing
 I think you said pretty much everyone is involved in fishing in some way
 Well, we eat fish every day, every day, and I think there is no doubt that our rate of consumption of fish is perhaps the highest in the world
 So you're dependent on fish, both at the local level and for the revenues that the country receives from the global fishing business for tuna, and yet despite that, a few years ago you took a very radical step
 Can you tell us about that? I think something happened right here in the Phoenix Islands
 Let me give some of the background of what fish means for us
 We have one of the largest tuna fisheries remaining in the world
 In the Pacific, I think we own something like 60 percent of the remaining tuna fisheries, and it remains relatively healthy for some species, but not all
 Of your national revenue
 But we decided to close this, and it was a very difficult decision
 I can assure you, politically, locally, it was not easy, but I was convinced that we had to do this in order to ensure that the fishery remains sustainable
 There had been some indications that some of the species, in particular the bigeye, was under serious threat
 The yellowfin was also heavily fished
 Skipjack remains healthy
 So in asking the international community to make a sacrifice, I thought we ourselves need to make that sacrifice
 And so we made the sacrifice
 And forgoing commercial fishing in the Phoenix Islands protected area would mean a loss of revenue
 We are still trying to assess what that loss would be because we actually closed it off at the beginning of this year, and so we will see by the end of this year what it means in terms of the lost revenue
 So there's so many things playing into this
 On the one hand, it may prompt healthier fisheries
 I mean, how much are you able to move the price up that you charge for the remaining areas?
 The negotiations have been very difficult, but we have managed to raise the cost of a vessel day
 For any vessel to come in to fish for a day, we have raised the fee from -- it was $6,000 and $8,000, now to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day
 And so there's been that significant increase
 But at the same time, what's important to note is, whereas in the past these fishing boats might be fishing in a day and maybe catch 10 tons, now they're catching maybe 100 tons because they've become so efficient
 And so we've got to respond likewise
 We've got to be very, very careful because the technology has so improved
 There was a time when the Brazilian fleet moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific
 They couldn't
 They started experimenting if they could, per se
 But now they've got ways of doing it, and they've become so efficient
 How do you hold the line? Is there any advice you can give to other leaders who are dealing with the same companies about how to get the most for your country, get the most for the fish? What advice would you give?
 Well, I think we focus too often on licensing in order to get the rate of return, because what we are getting from license fees is about 10 percent of the landed value of the catch on the side of the wharf, not in the retail shops
 What we have been trying to do over the years is actually to increase our participation in the industry, in the harvesting, in the processing, and eventually, hopefully, the marketing
 They're not easy to penetrate, but we are working towards that, and yes, the answer would be to enhance
 And so we've started doing that, and we have to restructure the industry
 We've got to tell these people that the world has changed
 Now we want to produce the fish ourselves
 And meanwhile, for your local fishermen, they are still able to fish, but what is business like for them? Is it getting harder? Are the waters depleted? Or is that being run on a sustainable basis?
 For the artisanal fishery, we do not participate in the commercial fishing activity except only to supply the domestic market
 The tuna fishery is really entirely for the foreign market, mostly here in the US, Europe, Japan
 So I am a fisherman, very much, and I used to be able to catch yellowfin
 Now it's very, very rare to be able to catch yellowfin because they are being lifted out of the water by the hundreds of tons by these purse seiners
 So here's a couple of beautiful girls from your country
 I mean, as you think about their future, what message would you have for them and what message would you have for the world?
 I think I have 12, my wife knows
 Every day I see my grandchildren, about the same age as these young girls, and I do wonder, and I get angry sometimes, yes I do
 I wonder what is to become of them
 And so it's about them that we should be telling everybody, that it's not about their own national interest, because climate change, regrettably, unfortunately, is viewed by many countries as a national problem
 It's not
 And this is the argument we got into recently with our partners, the Australians and New Zealanders, because they said, "We can't cut any more
" This is what one of the leaders, the Australian leader, said, that we've done our part, we are cutting back
 I said, What about the rest? Why don't you keep it? If you could keep the rest of your emissions within your boundaries, within your borders, we'd have no question
 You can go ahead as much as you like
 But unfortunately, you're sending it our way, and it's affecting the future of our children
We will be meeting in Paris at the end of this year, but until we can think of this as a global phenomenon, because we create it, individually, as nations, but it affects everybody else, and yet, we refuse to do anything about it, and we deal with it as a national problem, which it is not -- it is a global issue, and it's got to be dealt with collectively
 People are incredibly bad at responding to graphs and numbers, and we shut our minds to it
 Somehow, to people, we're slightly better at responding to that sometimes
 And it seems like it's very possible that your nation, despite, actually because of the intense problems you face, you may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly, most powerfully
 I just want to thank you, I'm sure, on behalf of all of us, for your extraordinary leadership and for being here
 President, thank you so much
 Thank you
What if I could present you a story that you would remember with your entire body and not just with your mind? My whole life as a journalist, I've really been compelled to try to make stories that can make a difference and maybe inspire people to care
 I've worked in documentary
 I've worked in broadcast
 But it really wasn't until I got involved with virtual reality that I started seeing these really intense, authentic reactions from people that really blew my mind
So the deal is that with VR, virtual reality, I can put you on scene in the middle of the story
 By putting on these goggles that track wherever you look, you get this whole-body sensation, like you're actually, like, there
 And I wanted to do a piece about hunger
 Families in America are going hungry, food banks are overwhelmed, and they're often running out of food
 Now, I knew I couldn't make people feel hungry, but maybe I could figure out a way to get them to feel something physical
So -- again, this is five years ago -- so doing journalism and virtual reality together was considered a worse-than-half-baked idea, and I had no funding
 Believe me, I had a lot of colleagues laughing at me
 And I did, though, have a really great intern, a woman named Michaela Kobsa-Mark
 And together we went out to food banks and started recording audio and photographs
 Until one day she came back to my office and she was bawling, she was just crying
 She had been on scene at a long line, where the woman running the line was feeling extremely overwhelmed, and she was screaming, "There's too many people! There's too many people!" And this man with diabetes doesn't get food in time, his blood sugar drops too low, and he collapses into a coma
 As soon as I heard that audio, I knew that this would be the kind of evocative piece that could really describe what was going on at food banks
 You can see how long it was, right? And again, as I said, we didn't have very much funding, so I had to reproduce it with virtual humans that were donated, and people begged and borrowed favors to help me create the models and make things as accurate as we could
 And then we tried to convey what happened that day with as much as accuracy as is possible
 There's too many people! There's too many people!
 OK, he's having a seizure
 So the man on the right, for him, he's walking around the body
 For him, he's in the room with that body
 Like, that guy is at his feet
 And even though, through his peripheral vision, he can see that he's in this lab space, he should be able to see that he's not actually on the street, but he feels like he's there with those people
 He's very cautious not to step on this guy who isn't really there, right?
So that piece ended up going to Sundance in 2012, a kind of amazing thing, and it was the first virtual reality film ever, basically
 And when we went, I was really terrified
 I didn't really know how people were going to react and what was going to happen
 And we showed up with this duct-taped pair of goggles
 Oh, you're crying
 You're crying
 Gina, you're crying
So you can hear the surprise in my voice, right? And this kind of reaction ended up being the kind of reaction we saw over and over and over: people down on the ground trying to comfort the seizure victim, trying to whisper something into his ear or in some way help, even though they couldn't
 And I had a lot of people come out of that piece saying, "Oh my God, I was so frustrated
 I couldn't help the guy," and take that back into their lives
So after this piece was made, the dean of the cinema school at USC, the University of Southern California, brought in the head of the World Economic Forum to try "Hunger," and he took off the goggles, and he commissioned a piece about Syria on the spot
 And I really wanted to do something about Syrian refugee kids, because children have been the worst affected by the Syrian civil war
 I sent a team to the border of Iraq to record material at refugee camps, basically an area I wouldn't send a team now, as that's where ISIS is really operating
 And then we also recreated a street scene in which a young girl is singing and a bomb goes off
 I've had individuals who have been involved in real bombings tell me that it evokes the same kind of fear
[The civil war in Syria may seem far away] [until you experience it yourself
]
[Project Syria] [A virtual reality experience]
 And it wasn't advertised
 And we were put in this tapestry room
 You know, maybe they would want to see the old storytelling of the tapestries
 They were confronted by our virtual reality cameras
 Things like, "It's so real," "Absolutely believable," or, of course, the one that I was excited about, "A real feeling as if you were in the middle of something that you normally see on the TV news
"
So, it works, right? This stuff works
Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm not saying that when you're in a piece you forget that you're here
 But it turns out we can feel like we're in two places at once
 We can have what I call this duality of presence, and I think that's what allows me to tap into these feelings of empathy
So that means, of course, that I have to be very cautious about creating these pieces
 If we don't capture the material ourselves, we have to be extremely exacting about figuring out the provenance and where did this stuff come from and is it authentic?
Let me give you an example
 With this Trayvon Martin case, this is a guy, a kid, who was 17 years old and he bought soda and a candy at a store, and on his way home he was tracked by a neighborhood watchman named George Zimmerman who ended up shooting and killing him
 To make that piece, we got the architectural drawings of the entire complex, and we rebuilt the entire scene inside and out, based on those drawings
 All of the action is informed by the real 911 recorded calls to the police
 The forensic house that did the audio reconstruction, Primeau Productions, they say that they would testify that George Zimmerman, when he got out of the car, he cocked his gun before he went to give chase to Martin
So you can see that the basic tenets of journalism, they don't really change here, right? We're still following the same principles that we would always
 What is different is the sense of being on scene, whether you're watching a guy collapse from hunger or feeling like you're in the middle of a bomb scene
 And this is kind of what has driven me forward with these pieces, and thinking about how to make them
 We're trying to make this, obviously, beyond the headset, more available
 We're creating mobile pieces like the Trayvon Martin piece
 And these things have had impact
 And "Hunger in LA," well, it's helped start a new form of doing journalism that I think is going to join all the other normal platforms in the future
Thank you
This is the Air Jordan 3 Black Cement
 This might be the most important sneaker in history
 This is the shoe that propelled the entire Air Jordan lineage, and perhaps saved Nike
 The Air Jordan 3 Black Cement did for sneakers what the iPhone did for phones
 It's been re-released four times
 Every celebrity's been seen wearing it
 There's a site about what to wear with the Black Cement
 It's been right under your nose for decades and you never looked down
 And right about now, most of you are probably thinking, "Sneakers?"
 Yes, sneakers
 Some extraordinary things about sneakers and data and Nike and how they're all related, possibly, to the future of all online commerce
 And that's because people were camped outside of sneaker stores for days before it went on sale
 And just minutes after that, thousands of those pairs were on eBay for two and three times retail
 In fact, there's over 1,000 pairs on eBay right now, four years later
 But here's the thing: this happens every single Saturday
 Every week there's another release or two or three, and every shoe has a story as rich and compelling as the Jordan 3 Black Cement
This is Nike building the marketplace for sneakerheads -- people who collect sneakers -- and my daughter
For the brands, sneakerheads are a very important demographic
 These are the tastemakers; these are the Apple fanboys
 Because who else is going to buy a pair of $8,000 Back to the Future sneakers?
Yeah, 8,000 dollars
And while that's obviously the anomaly, the resell sneaker market is definitely not
 Thirty years in the making, what started as an underground culture of a few people who like sneakers just a bit too much --
Now we have sneaker addictions
2 billion dollars
 This is my collection
 I have about 250 pairs, but trust me, I am small-time
 People have thousands
 I grew up playing basketball when Michael Jordan played, I always wanted Air Jordans, my mother would never buy me Air Jordans, as soon as I got some money I bought Air Jordans -- literally, we all have the exact same story
 But here's where mine diverged
 After starting three companies, I took a job as a strategy consultant, when I very quickly realized that I didn't know the first thing about data
 But I learned, because I had to, and I liked it
 So I thought, I wonder if I could get ahold of some sneaker data, just to play with for my own amusement
 The goal was to develop a price guide, a real data-driven view of the market
 And four years later, we're analyzing over 25 million transactions, providing real-time analytics on thousands of sneakers
 Now sneakerheads check prices while camping out for releases
 Others have used the data to validate insurance claims
 And here's the best part: sneakerheads have sneaker portfolios
Sneakerheads can track the value of their collection over time, compare it to others, and have access to the same analytics you might for your online brokerage account
 So sneakerhead Dan builds his collection and identifies which 352 are his
 He can see it's worth 103,000 dollars -- frankly, a modest collection
 Here he's made over 600 dollars on one pair
 I have one of those
So an unregulated 1
2 billion dollar industry that thrives as much on the street as it does online, and has spawned fundamental financial services for sneakers? At some point I asked myself what's really going on in the market, and two comparisons started to emerge
 Are sneakers more like stocks or drugs?
In fact, one guy emailed to say he thought his 15-year-old son was selling drugs and later found out he was selling sneakers
And now they use the data to do it together
 And I don't just mean the kid selling sneakers instead of drugs
 How about all kids? You have to be 18 to play the stock market
 I sold chewing gum in sixth grade, Blow Pops in ninth grade and collected baseball cards through high school
 The cards are long dead, and the candy market's usually quite local
For a lot of people, sneakers are a legal and accessible investment opportunity -- a democratized stock market, but also unregulated
 Which is why the story you're probably most familiar with is people killing each other for sneakers
 In fact, it's a very small piece of a much bigger and better story
So sneakers have clear similarities to both the stock exchange and the illegal drug trade, but perhaps the most fundamental is the existence of a central actor
 Someone is making the rules
Let me walk you through some numbers
The resell market, we know, is $1
 Nike, including Jordan brand, accounts for 96 percent of all shoes sold on the secondary market
 Sneakerheads love Jordans
 And profit on the secondary market is about a third
 Let's jump to retail for a second
 Skechers, earlier this year, became the number two footwear brand in the country, surpassing Adidas -- this was a big deal
 And in the 12 months ending in June, Skechers's net income was 209 million dollars
 That means that Nike's customers make almost twice as much profit as their closest competitor
 That --
How is that even possible?
 Shoes that sell for 8,000 dollars do so because they're very rare
 It's no different than any other collectible market, only this isn't a market at all
 It's a false construct created by Nike -- ingeniously created by Nike, in the most positive sense -- to sell more shoes
 If Nike wanted to kill the resell market, they could do so tomorrow, all they have to do is release more shoes
 But we certainly don't want them to, nor is it in their best interest
 That's because unlike Apple, who will sell an iPhone to anyone who wants one, Nike doesn't make their money by just selling $200 sneakers
 They sell millions of shoes to millions of people for 60 dollars
 And sneakerheads are the ones who drive the marketing and the hype and the PR and the brand cachet, and enable Nike to sell millions of $60 sneakers
It's marketing
 It's marketing the likes of which has never been seen before -- this isn't in any textbook
 Drive by any Footlocker at 8am on a Saturday morning, and there will be a line down the street and around the block, and sometimes those kids have been waiting there all week
 So Nike sets the rules
 And they do so by controlling supply and distribution
But once a pair leaves the retail channel, it's the Wild West
 So Nike is definitely not the stock exchange
 In fact, there is no central exchange
 By last count, there were 48 different online markets that I know of
 Some are eBay clones, some are mobile markets, and then you have consignment shops and brick-and-mortar stores, and sneaker conventions, and reseller sites, and Facebook and Instagram and Twitter -- literally, anywhere sneakerheads come into contact with each other, shoes will be bought and sold
 Can you imagine if that's how stocks were bought? What if the way to buy a share of Apple stock was to search over 100 places online and off, including every time you walk down the street just hoping to pass someone wearing some Apple stock? Never knowing who had the best price, or even if the stock you were looking at was real
 That would surely make you say:
[WTF?]
Of course that's not how we buy stock
 But what if that's not how we need to buy sneakers either? What if the inverse is true, and what if we could buy sneakers exactly the same way as we buy stock? And what if it wasn't just sneakers, but any similar product, like watches and handbags and women's shoes, and any collectible, any seasonal item and any markdown item? What if there was a stock market for commerce? A stock market of things
 And not only could you buy in a much more educated and efficient manner, but you could engage in all the sophisticated financial transactions you can with the stock market
 Shorts and options and futures and well, maybe you see where this is going
 Maybe you want to invest in a stock market of things
 Because if you had invested in a pair of Air Jordan 3 Black Cement in 2011, you could either be wearing them onstage,
And that's why we're talking about sneakers
It was April 8, 2003
 That day, Americans tanks started arriving in Baghdad
 We were just a few journalists in the Palestine Hotel, and, as happens in war, the fighting began to approach outside our windows
 Baghdad was covered in black smoke and oil
 It smelled awful
 We couldn't see a thing, but we knew what was happening
 So I was in my room on the 16th floor, writing and looking out the window every now and then to see what was happening
 During the previous three weeks, there had been shelling with half-ton missiles, but this time, the shock -- I felt it inside of me, and I thought, "It's very close
 It's very, very close
"
So I went down to see what was happening
 I went down to the 15th floor to take a look
 And I saw people, journalists, screaming in the hallways
 Someone had been wounded
 There was a man near the window, a cameraman named Taras Protsyuk, lying face-down
 Having worked in a hospital before, I wanted to help out
 So I turned him over
 All I saw was a white, pearly, shiny spot that blinded me, and I didn't understand what was going on
Once the spot disappeared and I could see his wound, which was very serious, my buddies and I put a sheet underneath him, and we carried him onto an elevator that stopped at each of the 15 floors
 He died on the way to the hospital
 The Spanish cameraman José Couso, who was on the 14th floor and also hit -- because the shell had exploded between the two floors -- died on the operating table
 There was that article I was supposed to write -- which I had to write
And so -- I returned to the hotel lobby with my arms covered in blood, when one of the hotel gofers stopped me and asked me to pay the tax I hadn't paid for 10 days
 I told him to get lost
 And I said to myself: "Clear your head, put it all aside
 If you want to write, you need to put it all aside
" And that's what I did
 I went upstairs, wrote my article and sent it off
Later, aside from the feeling of having lost my colleagues, something else was bothering me
 I kept seeing that shiny, pearly spot, and I couldn't understand what it meant
 "That's not possible
 I can't just not know what happened
" Because it wasn't the first time, and it didn't only happen to me
 I have seen things like that happen to others in my 20 to 35 years of reporting
 I have seen things that had an effect on me too
 For example, there was this man I knew in Lebanon, a 25-year-old veteran who had been fighting for five years -- a real veteran -- who we would follow everywhere
 He would crawl in the dark with confidence -- he was a great soldier, a true soldier -- so we would follow him, knowing that we would be safe with him
 And one day, as I was told -- and I've seen him again since -- he was back in the camp, playing cards, when someone came in next door, and discharged their weapon
 As the gun went off, that blast, that one shot, made him duck quickly under the table, like a child
 He was shaking, panicking
 And since then, he has never been able to get up and fight
So I thought to myself, "What is this thing that can kill you without leaving any visible scars? How does that happen? What is this unknown thing?" It was too common to be coincidental
So I started to investigate -- that's all I know how to do
 I started to investigate by looking through books, reaching out to psychiatrists, going to museums, libraries, etc
 Finally, I discovered that some people knew about this -- often military psychiatrists -- and that what we were dealing with was called trauma
 Americans call it PTSD or traumatic neurosis
So, this trauma -- what is it? Well, it's an encounter with death
 I don't know if you've ever had an experience with death -- I'm not talking about dead bodies, or someone's grandfather lying in a hospital bed, or someone who got hit by a car
 I'm talking about facing the void of death
 And that is something no one is supposed to see
 People used to say, "Neither the sun, nor death can be looked at with a steady eye
" A human being should not have to face the void of death
But when that happens, it can remain invisible for a while -- days, weeks, months, sometimes years
 And then, at some point, it explodes, because it's something that has entered your brain -- a sort of window between an image and your mind -- that has penetrated your brain, staying there and taking up all the space inside
 And there are people -- men, women, who suddenly no longer sleep
 And they experience horrible anxiety attacks -- panic attacks, not just minor fears
 They suddenly don't want to sleep, because when they do, they have the same nightmare every night
 They see the same image every night
 What type of image? For example, a soldier who enters a building and comes face to face with another soldier aiming at him
 He looks at the gun, straight down the barrel
 And this barrel suddenly becomes enormous, deformed
 It becomes fluffy, swallowing everything
 And he says -- later he will say, "I saw death
 I saw myself dead, therefore I'm dead
" And from then on, he knows he is dead
 It is not a perception -- he is convinced that he is dead
 In reality, someone came in, the guy left or didn't shoot, whatever, and he didn't actually get shot -- but to him, he died in that moment
 Or it can be the smell of a mass grave -- I saw a lot of that in Rwanda
 It can be the voice of a friend calling, and they're being slaughtered and there's nothing you can do
 You hear that voice, and you wake up every night -- for weeks, months -- in a trance-like state, anxious and terrified, like a child
 I have seen men cry -- just like children -- from seeing the same image
 You go home and don't recognize anyone
 You don't even recognize yourself
 You hide and don't leave the house, you lock yourself in, you become ill
 I know people who placed small cans outside their house with coins inside, in case someone tried to get in
 All of a sudden, you feel like you want to die or kill or hide or run away
 They say, "There's nothing wrong with you
 You seem fine, you have no injuries
 You went to war, came back; you're fine
" These people suffer tremendously
 Some commit suicide
 After all, suicide is like updating your daily planner -- I'm already dead, I might as well commit suicide
 Plus, there is no more pain
 Some commit suicide, others end up under the bridge, drinking
 Everyone remembers that grandfather or uncle or neighbor who used to drink, never said a word, always in a bad mood, beat his wife and who would end up either sinking into alcoholism or dying
And why do we not talk about this? We don't talk about it because it's taboo
 It's not like we don't have the words to express the void of death
 But others don't want hear it
 The first time I returned from an assignment, They said, "Oh! He's back
" There was a fancy dinner -- white tablecloth, candles, guests
 "Tell us everything!" Which I did
 After 20 minutes, people were giving me dirty looks, the hostess had her nose in the ashtray
 It was horrible and I realized I ruined the whole evening
 So I don't talk about it anymore
 We're just not ready to listen
 People say outright: "Please, stop
Is that a rare occurrence? No, it's extremely common
 One third of the soldiers who died in Iraq -- well, not "died," let me re-phrase that -- one third of the US soldiers who went to Iraq suffer from PTSD
 In 1939, there were still 200,000 soldiers from the First World War that were being treated in British psychiatric hospitals
 In Vietnam, 54,000 people died -- Americans
 In 1987, the US government identified 102,000 -- twice as many -- 102,000 veterans who died from committing suicide
 Twice as many deaths by suicide than by combat in Vietnam
 So why do we not talk about it? Why have we not talked about it? The problem is that if you don't talk about it, you're heading for disaster
The only way to heal -- and the good news here is that this is treatable -- think Munch's The Scream, Goya, etc
 -- it's indeed treatable
 The only way to heal from this trauma, from this encounter with death that overwhelms, petrifies and kills you is to find a way to express it
People used to say, "Language is the only thing that holds all of us together
" Without language, we're nothing
 It's the thing that makes us human
 In the face of such a horrible image -- a wordless image of oblivion that obsesses us -- the only way to cope with it is to put human words to it
 No one wants to see them anymore and they don't want to see anyone
 Someone said, "Doctor, I don't use the subway anymore because I'm afraid people will see the horror in my eyes
" Another guy thought he had a terrible skin disease and spent six months with dermatologists, going from doctor to doctor
 And then one day, they sent him to a psychiatrist
 During his second session, he told the psychiatrist he had a terrible skin disease from head to toe
"
So you see this is something that has a profound effect on people
 In order to heal, we need to talk about it
 The horror needs to be put into words -- human words, so we can organize it and talk about it again
 We have to look death in the face
 And if we can do that, if we can talk about these things, then step by step, by working it out verbally, we can reclaim our place in humanity
 And it is important
 Silence kills us
So what does this mean? It means that after a trauma, without question, we lose our "unbearable lightness of being," that sense of immortality that keeps us here -- meaning, if we're here, we almost feel like we're immortal, which we're not, but if we didn't believe that, we'd say, "What's the point of it all?" But trauma survivors have lost that feeling of immortality
 But they have found something else
 Five friends of mine committed suicide, they're the ones who did not survive the trauma
So if we can look death in the face, if we, mortal humans, human mortals, understand that we are human and mortal, mortal and human, if we can confront death and identify it once again as the most mysterious place of all mysterious places, since no one has ever seen it -- if we can give it back this meaning, yes, we may die, survive and come back to life, but we'll come back stronger than before
 Much stronger
Thank you
Religion is more than belief
 It's power, and it's influence
 And that influence affects all of us, every day, regardless of your own belief
 Despite the enormous influence of religion on the world today, we hold them to a different standard of scrutiny and accountability than any other sector of our society
 For example, if there were a multinational organization, government or corporation today that said no female could be on a leadership board, not one woman could have a decision-making authority, not one woman could handle any financial matter, we would have outrage
 There would be sanctions
 And yet this is a common practice in almost every world religion today
We accept things in our religious lives that we do not accept in our secular lives, and I know this because I've been doing it for three decades
 I was the type of girl that fought every form of gender discrimination growing up
 I said I was going to be the first female President of the United States
 I have been fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment, which has been dead for 40 years
 I'm the first woman in both sides of my family to ever work outside the home and ever receive a higher education
I never accepted being excluded because I was a woman, except in my religion
 Throughout all of that time, I was a part of a very patriarchal orthodox Mormon religion
 I have eight siblings, a stay-at-home mother
 And I grew up in a world believing that my worth and my standing was in keeping these rules that I'd known my whole life
Everything about Mormonism determined what you wore, who you dated, who you married
 It determined what underwear we wore
 I was the kind of religious where everyone I know donated 10 percent of everything they earned to the church, including myself
 From paper routes and babysitting, I donated 10 percent
 But I was also the kind of religious where it didn't matter where in the world I lived, I had friendship, instantaneous mutual aid
 This was where I felt safe
 This is certainty and clarity about life
 I had help raising my little daughter
 And I allowed discrepancies between men and women in operating budgets, disciplinary councils, in decision-making capacities, and I gave my religion a free pass because I loved it
Until I stopped, and I realized that I had been allowing myself to be treated as the support staff to the real work of men
 We've been working very, very, very hard for the last decade and more
The first thing we did was raise consciousness
 You can't change what you can't see
 We started podcasting, blogging, writing articles
 I created lists of hundreds of ways that men and women are unequal in our community
 We tried to do things that were unignorable, like wearing pants to church and trying to attend all-male meetings
 These seem like simple things, but to us, the organizers, they were enormously costly
 We lost relationships
 We lost jobs
 We got hate mail on a daily basis
 We were attacked in social media and national press
 We received death threats
 Some of us got excommunicated
And I began to expect this reaction from my own people
 I know what it feels like when you feel like someone's trying to change you or criticize you
 But what utterly shocked me was throughout all of this work I received equal measures of vitriol from the secular left, the same vehemence as the religious right
 And what my secular friends didn't realize was that this religious hostility, these phrases of, "Oh, all religious people are crazy or stupid
" "Don't pay attention to religion
" "They're going to be homophobic and sexist
" What they didn't understand was that that type of hostility did not fight religious extremism, it bred religious extremism
 Those arguments don't work, and I know because I remember someone telling me that I was stupid for being Mormon
 And what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people and everything we believe in, because we're not stupid
So criticism and hostility doesn't work, and I didn't listen to these arguments
 These are my people, and I'm the first to defend them, but the struggle is real
 I still don't have a perfect answer
 My parents and I have been walking on this tightrope for the last decade
 They're intelligent people
 They're lovely people
 And let me try to help you understand their perspective
 In Mormonism, we believe that after you die, if you keep all the rules and you follow all the rituals, you can be together as a family again
 And to my parents, me doing something as simple as having a sleeveless top right now, showing my shoulders, that makes me unworthy
 I won't be with my family in the eternities
 But even more, I had a brother die in a tragic accident at 15, and something as simple as this means we won't be together as a family
 And to my parents, they cannot understand why something as simple as fashion or women's rights would prevent me from seeing my brother again
 And that's the mindset that we're dealing with, and criticism does not change that
 And so my parents and I have been walking this tightrope, explaining our sides, respecting one another, but actually invalidating each other's very basic beliefs by the way we live our lives, and it's been difficult
The other thing that the secular left and the atheists and the orthodox and the religious right, what they all don't understand was why even care about religious activism? I cannot tell you the hundreds of people who have said, "If you don't like religion, just leave
" Why would you try to change it? Because what is taught on the Sabbath leaks into our politics, our health policy, violence around the world
 It leaks into education, military, fiscal decision-making
 These laws get legally and culturally codified
 In fact, my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation
 For example, during Prop 8, my church raised over 22 million dollars to fight same-sex marriage in California
 Forty years ago, political historians will say, that if it wasn't for the Mormon opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment, we'd have an Equal Rights Amendment in our Constitution today
 How many lives did that affect? And we can spend time fighting every single one of these little tiny laws and rules, or we can ask ourselves, why is gender inequality the default around the world? Why is that the assumption?
Because religion doesn't just create the roots of morality, it creates the seeds of normality
 Religions can liberate or subjugate, they can empower or exploit, they can comfort or destroy, and the people that tip the scales over to the ethical and the moral are often not those in charge
 Religions can't be dismissed or ignored
 We need to take them seriously
 But it's not easy to influence a religion, like we just talked about
But I'll tell you what my people have done
 My groups are small, there's hundreds of us, but we've had huge impact
 Right now, women's pictures are hanging in the halls next to men for the first time
 As of last week, in a historic move, three women were invited down to three leadership boards that oversee the entire church
 We've seen perceptual shifts in the Mormon community that allow for talk of gender inequality
 We've opened up space, regardless of being despised, for more conservative women to step in and make real changes, and the words "women" and "the priesthood" can now be uttered in the same sentence
 I never had that
 My daughter and my nieces are inheriting a religion that I never had, that's more equal -- we've had an effect
 But not one woman in that line will forget that day, and not one little boy that walked past us will forget that day
If we were a multinational corporation or a government, and that had happened, there would be outrage, but we're just a religion
 We're all just part of religions
 We can't keep looking at religion that way, because it doesn't only affect me, it affects my daughter and all of your daughters and what opportunities they have, what they can wear, who they can love and marry, if they have access to reproductive healthcare
 We need to reclaim morality in a secular context that creates ethical scrutiny and accountability for religions all around the world, but we need to do it in a respectful way that breeds cooperation and not extremism
 And we can do it through unignorable acts of bravery, standing up for gender equality
It's time that half of the world's population had voice and equality within our world's religions, churches, synagogues, mosques and shrines around the world
So whenever I visit a school and talk to students, I always ask them the same thing: Why do you Google? Why is Google the search engine of choice for you? Strangely enough, I always get the same three answers
 One, "Because it works," which is a great answer; that's why I Google, too
 Two, somebody will say, "I really don't know of any alternatives
" It's not an equally great answer and my reply to that is usually, "Try to Google the word 'search engine,' you may find a couple of interesting alternatives
" And last but not least, thirdly, inevitably, one student will raise her or his hand and say, "With Google, I'm certain to always get the best, unbiased search result
" Certain to always get the best, unbiased search result
Now, as a man of the humanities, albeit a digital humanities man, that just makes my skin curl, even if I, too, realize that that trust, that idea of the unbiased search result is a cornerstone in our collective love for and appreciation of Google
 So whenever you set out to Google something, start by asking yourself this: "Am I looking for an isolated fact?" What is the capital of France? What are the building blocks of a water molecule? Great -- Google away
 There's not a group of scientists who are this close to proving that it's actually London and H30
 You don't see a big conspiracy among those things
 We agree, on a global scale, what the answers are to these isolated facts
 And to get to knowledge, you have to bring 10 or 20 or 100 facts to the table and acknowledge them and say, "Yes, these are all true
" But because of who I am, young or old, black or white, gay or straight, I will value them differently
 And I will say, "Yes, this is true, but this is more important to me than that
" And this is where it becomes interesting, because this is where we become human
 This is when we start to argue, to form society
 And to really get somewhere, we need to filter all our facts here, through friends and neighbors and parents and children and coworkers and newspapers and magazines, to finally be grounded in real knowledge, which is something that a search engine is a poor help to achieve
So, I promised you an example just to show you why it's so hard to get to the point of true, clean, objective knowledge -- as food for thought
 I will conduct a couple of simple queries, search queries
 We'll start with "Michelle Obama," the First Lady of the United States
 And we'll click for pictures
 It works really well, as you can see
 It's a perfect search result, more or less
 It's just her in the picture, not even the President
How does this work? Quite simple
 Google uses a lot of smartness to achieve this, but quite simply, they look at two things more than anything
 First, what does it say in the caption under the picture on each website? Does it say "Michelle Obama" under the picture? Pretty good indication it's actually her on there
 Second, Google looks at the picture file, the name of the file as such uploaded to the website
 Again, is it called "MichelleObama
jpeg"? Pretty good indication it's not Clint Eastwood in the picture
 So, you've got those two and you get a search result like this -- almost
 There was a picture distributed widely over the Internet where her face was distorted to look like a monkey
 And people published it very, very purposefully, to get it up there in the search results
 They made sure to write "Michelle Obama" in the caption and they made sure to upload the picture as "MichelleObama
jpeg," or the like
 You get why -- to manipulate the search result
 And it worked, too
 So when you picture-Googled for "Michelle Obama" in 2009, that distorted monkey picture showed up among the first results
Now, the results are self-cleansing, and that's sort of the beauty of it, because Google measures relevance every hour, every day
 However, Google didn't settle for that this time, they just thought, "That's racist and it's a bad search result and we're going to go back and clean that up manually
 We are going to write some code and fix it," which they did
 And I don't think anyone in this room thinks that was a bad idea
 Me neither
But then, a couple of years go by, and the world's most-Googled Anders, Anders Behring Breivik, did what he did
 This man, a terrorist, blew up a couple of government buildings walking distance from where we are right now in Oslo, Norway and then he traveled to the island of Utøya and shot and killed a group of kids
 Almost 80 people died that day
 It was three steps
 And he prepared all three steps equally well
 He's also a very political guy and he was right out there in social media, on his blog and Facebook
 Let's see if we can distort that
 Let's see if we, in the civilized world, can protest against what he did through insulting him in his search results
"
And how? He told all of his readers the following, "Go out there on the Internet, find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks -- find pictures of dog poop on sidewalks -- publish them in your feeds, on your websites, on your blogs
 Make sure to write the terrorist's name in the caption, make sure to name the picture file "Breivik
jpeg
" Let's teach Google that that's the face of the terrorist
" And it worked
 Two years after that campaign against Michelle Obama, this manipulation campaign against Anders Behring Breivik worked
 If you picture-Googled for him weeks after the July 22 events from Sweden, you'd see that picture of dog poop high up in the search results, as a little protest
Strangely enough, Google didn't intervene this time
 So the million-dollar question, is there anything different between these two happenings here? Is there anything different between what happened to Michelle Obama and what happened to Anders Behring Breivik? Of course not
 It's the exact same thing, yet Google intervened in one case and not in the other
Why? Because Michelle Obama is an honorable person, that's why, and Anders Behring Breivik is a despicable person
 See what happens there? An evaluation of a person takes place and there's only one power-player in the world with the authority to say who's who
 "We like you, we dislike you
 We believe in you, we don't believe in you
 You're right, you're wrong
 You're Obama, and you're Breivik
So I'm asking you to remember that behind every algorithm is always a person, a person with a set of personal beliefs that no code can ever completely eradicate
 And my message goes out not only to Google, but to all believers in the faith of code around the world
 You need to understand that you are human and take responsibility accordingly
And I say this because I believe we've reached a point in time when it's absolutely imperative that we tie those bonds together again, tighter: the humanities and the technology
 Tighter than ever
 And, if nothing else, to remind us that that wonderfully seductive idea of the unbiased, clean search result is, and is likely to remain, a myth
Thank you for your time
 When I told my parents I was gay, the first thing they said to me was, "We're bringing you back to Taiwan
"
In their minds, my sexual orientation was America's fault
 The West had corrupted me with divergent ideas, and if only my parents had never left Taiwan, this would not have happened to their only daughter
 In truth, I wondered if they were right
Of course, there are gay people in Asia, just as there are gay people in every part of the world
 But is the idea of living an "out" life, in the "I'm gay, this is my spouse, and we're proud of our lives together" kind of way just a Western idea?
 I had similar notions
 They told me their stories of persecution in their home countries, just for being gay, and the reasons why they escaped to the US
 I saw how this had beaten them down
 After 10 years of doing this kind of work, I needed better stories for myself
 I knew the world was far from perfect, but surely not every gay story was tragic
 So as a couple, we both had a need to find stories of hope
 So we set off on a mission to travel the world and look for the people we finally termed as the "Supergays
 They would be courageous, resilient, and most of all, proud of who they were
 Our plan was to share their stories to the world through film
 We had zero reporting and zero filmmaking experience
We didn't even know where to find the Supergays, so we just had to trust that we'd figure it all out along the way
 So we picked 15 countries in Asia, Africa and South America, countries outside the West that varied in terms of LGBT rights
 We bought a camcorder, ordered a book on how to make a documentary --
you can learn a lot these days -- and set off on an around-the-world trip
 One of the first countries that we traveled to was Nepal
 One of the key figures in the movement is Bhumika Shrestha
 A beautiful, vibrant transgendered woman, Bhumika has had to overcome being expelled from school and getting incarcerated because of her gender presentation
 I'm so proud of my life
 I can appreciate Bhumika's confidence on a daily basis
 Something as simple as using a public restroom can be a huge challenge when you don't fit in to people's strict gender expectations
 Traveling throughout Asia, I tended to freak out women in public restrooms
 They weren't used to seeing someone like me
 I had to come up with a strategy, so that I could just pee in peace
So anytime I would enter a restroom, I would thrust out my chest to show my womanly parts, and try to be as non-threatening as possible
 Putting out my hands and saying, "Hello", just so that people could hear my feminine voice
 I can't be anything else
 After Nepal, we traveled to India
 When we spoke to activists, they told us that empowerment begins with ensuring proper gender equality, where the women's status is established in society
 And in that way, the status of LGBT people can be affirmed as well
 There we met Prince Manvendra
 He's the world's first openly gay prince
 Prince Manvendra came out on the "Oprah Winfrey Show," very internationally
 His parents disowned him and accused him of bringing great shame to the royal family
 We sat down with Prince Manvendra and talked to him about why he decided to come out so very publicly
 I felt there was a lot of need to break this stigma and discrimination which is existing in our society
 And that instigated me to come out openly and talk about myself
 Gay rights cannot be won in the court rooms, but in the hearts and the minds of the people
 When I explained to her that I was with a woman instead of a man, she was incredulous, and she asked me a lot of questions about my parents' reactions and whether I was sad that I'd never be able to have children
 I told her that there are no limitations to my life and that Lisa and I do plan to have a family some day
 Now, this woman was ready to write me off as yet another crazy Westerner
 She couldn't imagine that such a phenomenon could happen in her own country
 That is, until I showed her the photos of the Supergays that we interviewed in India
 She recognized Prince Manvendra from television and soon I had an audience of other hairdressers interested in meeting me
And in that ordinary afternoon, I had the chance to introduce an entire beauty salon to the social changes that were happening in their own country
 From India, we traveled to East Africa, a region known for intolerance towards LGBT people
 In Kenya, 89 percent of people who come out to their families are disowned
 Homosexual acts are a crime and can lead to incarceration
 David had a huge mission of wanting to work for the poor and improve his own government
 So he decided to run for senate
 He became Kenya's first openly gay political candidate
 David wanted to run his campaign without denying the reality of who he was
 But we were worried for his safety because he started to receive death threats
 At that point, I was really scared because they were actually asking for me to be killed
 And, yeah, there are some people out there who do it and they feel that they are doing a religious obligation
 Even in the face of threats, he stayed authentic
 At the opposite end of the spectrum is Argentina
 Argentina's a country where 92 percent of the population identifies as Catholic
 In 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America and the 10th in the world to adopt marriage equality
There, we met María Rachid
 María was a driving force behind that movement
 I always say that, in reality, the effects of marriage equality are not only for those couples that get married
 They are for a lot of people that, even though they may never get married, will be perceived differently by their coworkers, their families and neighbors, from the national state's message of equality
 I feel very proud of Argentina because Argentina today is a model of equality
 And hopefully soon, the whole world will have the same rights
 When we made the visit to my ancestral lands, I wish I could have shown my parents what we found there
 Because here is who we met:
 One, two, three
A whole community of young, beautiful Chinese LGBT people
 Sure, they had their struggles
 But they were fighting it out
 In Shanghai, I had the chance to speak to a local lesbian group and tell them our story in my broken Mandarin Chinese
 In Taipei, each time we got onto the metro, we saw yet another lesbian couple holding hands
 And we learned that Asia's largest LGBT pride event happens just blocks away from where my grandparents live
 If only my parents knew
 By the time we finished our not-so-straight journey around the world,
we had traveled 50,000 miles and logged 120 hours of video footage
 We traveled to 15 countries and interviewed 50 Supergays
 Yes, there are still tragedies that happen on the bumpy road to equality
 What we ultimately took away from our journey is, equality is not a Western invention
 One of the key factors in this equality movement is momentum, momentum as more and more people embrace their full selves and use whatever opportunities they have to change their part of the world, and momentum as more and more countries find models of equality in one another
 When Nepal protected against LGBT discrimination, India pushed harder
 When Argentina embraced marriage equality, Uruguay and Brazil followed
 When Ireland said yes to equality,
the world stopped to notice
 When the US Supreme Court makes a statement to the world that we can all be proud of
 As we reviewed our footage, what we realized is that we were watching a love story
 It wasn't a love story that was expected of me, but it is one filled with more freedom, adventure and love than I could have ever possibly imagined
 And in the end, we believe, love will win out
 You may kiss
I would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a video from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp to a solar cell with a laptop acting as a receiver
 There is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light
In my view, such an extension of the Internet can only work if it's almost energy-neutral
 This means we need to use existing infrastructure as much as possible
 And this is where the solar cell and the LED come in
I demonstrated for the first time, at TED in 2011, Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity
 Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs to transmit data incredibly fast, and also in a safe and secure manner
 Data is transported by the light, encoded in subtle changes of the brightness
 If we look around, we have many LEDs around us, so there's a rich infrastructure of Li-Fi transmitters around us
 But so far, we have been using special devices -- small photo detectors, to receive the information encoded in the data
 I wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure to receive data from our Li-Fi lights
 And this is why I have been looking into solar cells and solar panels
A solar cell absorbs light and converts it into electrical energy
 This is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone
 But now we need to remember that the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness of the LED, so if the incoming light fluctuates, so does the energy harvested from the solar cell
 This means we have a principal mechanism in place to receive information from the light and by the solar cell, because the fluctuations of the energy harvested correspond to the data transmitted
Of course the question is: can we receive very fast and subtle changes of the brightness, such as the ones transmitted by our LED lights? And the answer to that is yes, we can
Now let me show you in practice
 In this box is a standard, off-the-shelf LED lamp
 This is a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell; it is connected to the laptop
 And also we have an instrument here to visualize the energy we harvest from the solar cell
Now what I would like to do first is switch on the light, and I'll simply, only switch on the light, for a moment, and what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right
 So the solar cell, for a moment, is harvesting energy from this artificial light source
 If I turn it off, we see it drops
 I turn it on 
 So we harvest energy with the solar cell
But next I would like to activate the streaming of the video
 And I've done this by pressing this button
 So now this LED lamp here is streaming a video by changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way, and in a way that you can't recognize with your eye, because the changes are too fast to recognize
 So first you notice the energy harvesting drops and the video stops as well
 If I remove the blockage, the video will restart
And I can repeat that
 So we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting stops as well
 So that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver
But now imagine that this LED lamp is a street light, and there's fog
 And so I want to simulate fog, and that's why I brought a handkerchief with me
And let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell
 First you notice the energy harvested drops, as expected, but now the video still continues
What's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver for high-speed wireless signals encoded in light, while it maintains its primary function as an energy-harvesting device
 That's why it is possible to use existing solar cells on the roof of a hut to act as a broadband receiver from a laser station on a close by hill, or indeed, lamp post
And It really doesn't matter where the beam hits the solar cell
 And the same is true for translucent solar cells integrated into windows, solar cells integrated into street furniture, or indeed, solar cells integrated into these billions of devices that will form the Internet of Things
 Because simply, we don't want to charge these devices regularly, or worse, replace the batteries every few months
As I said to you, this is the first time I've shown this in public
 It's very much a lab demonstration, a prototype
 But my team and I are confident that we can take this to market within the next two to three years
 And we hope we will be able to contribute to closing the digital divide, and also contribute to connecting all these billions of devices to the Internet
 And all of this without causing a massive explosion of energy consumption -- because of the solar cells, quite the opposite
Thank you
 This is a tapir
 Now this, this is a baby tapir, the cutest animal offspring in the animal kingdom
By far
 There is no competition here
 But at the moment, I've been thinking really, really hard about the impact of my work
 I've been questioning myself about the real contributions I have made for the conservation of these animals I love so much
 Am I being effective in safeguarding their survival? Am I doing enough? I guess the big question here is, am I studying tapirs and contributing to their conservation, or am I just documenting their extinction?
The world is facing so many different conservation crises
 We all know that
 It's all over the news every day
 Tropical forests and other ecosystems are being destroyed, climate change, so many species on the brink of extinction: tigers, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs
This is the lowland tapir, the tapir species I work with, the largest terrestrial mammal of South America
 They're powerful
 Adults can weigh up to 300 kilos
 That's half the size of a horse
 They're gorgeous
Tapirs are mostly found in tropical forests such as the Amazon, and they absolutely need large patches of habitat in order to find all the resources they need to reproduce and survive
 But their habitat is being destroyed, and they have been hunted out of several parts of their geographic distribution
And you see, this is very, very unfortunate because tapirs are extremely important for the habitats where they are found
 They're herbivores
 Fifty percent of their diet consists of fruit, and when they eat the fruit, they swallow the seeds, which they disperse throughout the habitat through their feces
 They play this major role in shaping and maintaining the structure and diversity of the forest, and for that reason, tapirs are known as gardeners of the forest
 Isn't that amazing? If you think about it, the extinction of tapirs would seriously affect biodiversity as a whole
I started my tapir work in 1996, still very young, fresh out of college, and it was a pioneer research and conservation program
 At that point, we had nearly zero information about tapirs, mostly because they're so difficult to study
 They're nocturnal, solitary, very elusive animals, and we got started getting very basic data about these animals
 We need field research
 We need those long-term datasets to support conservation action, and I told you tapirs are very hard to study, so we have to rely on indirect methods to study them
 We have to capture and anesthetize them so that we can install GPS collars around their necks and follow their movements, which is a technique used by many other conservationists around the world
Next, we must disseminate what we learn
 And it's amazing how many people around the world do not know what a tapir is
 In fact, many people think this is a tapir
 Let me tell you, this is not a tapir
This is a giant anteater
 Tapirs do not eat ants
 Ever
And then next we have to provide training, capacity building
 It is our responsibility to prepare the conservationists of the future
 We are losing several conservation battles, and we need more people doing what we do, and they need the skills, and they need the passion to do that
 Ultimately, we conservationists, we must be able to apply our data, to apply our accumulated knowledge to support actual conservation action
 Our first tapir program took place in the Atlantic Forest in the eastern part of Brazil, one of the most threatened biomes in the world
 The destruction of the Atlantic Forest began in the early 1500s, when the Portuguese first arrived in Brazil, beginning European colonization in the eastern part of South America
 This forest was almost completely cleared for timber, agriculture, cattle ranching and the construction of cities, and today only seven percent of the Atlantic forest is still left standing
 And tapirs are found in very, very small, isolated, disconnected populations
 In the Atlantic Forest, we found out that tapirs move through open areas of pastureland and agriculture going from one patch of forest to patch of forest
 So our main approach in this region was to use our tapir data to identify the potential places for the establishment of wildlife corridors in between those patches of forest, reconnecting the habitat so that tapirs and many other animals could cross the landscape safely
After 12 years in the Atlantic Forest, in 2008, we expanded our tapir conservation efforts to the Pantanal in the western part of Brazil near the border with Bolivia and Paraguay
 And working in the Pantanal has been extremely refreshing because we found large, healthy tapir populations in the area, and we have been able to study tapirs in the most natural conditions we'll ever find, very much free of threats
In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars, we are using another technique: camera traps
 So thanks to these amazing devices, we have been able to gather precious information about tapir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you're trying to develop those conservation strategies
And right now, 2015, we are expanding our work once again to the Brazilian Cerrado, the open grasslands and shrub forests in the central part of Brazil
 Today this region is the very epicenter of economic development in my country, where natural habitat and wildlife populations are rapidly being eradicated by several different threats, including once again cattle ranching, large sugarcane and soybean plantations, poaching, roadkill, just to name a few
 And somehow, tapirs are still there, which gives me a lot of hope
 But I have to say that starting this new program in the Cerrado was a bit of a slap in the face
 I am swimming against the tide
 It made me realize that despite two decades of hard work trying to save these animals, we still have so much work to do if we are to prevent them from disappearing
 We really do, and you know what? We really came to a point in the conservation world where we have to think out of the box
 And I told you, roadkill is a big problem for tapirs in the Cerrado, so we just came up with the idea of putting reflective stickers on the GPS collars we put on the tapirs
 These are the same stickers used on big trucks to avoid collision
 Tapirs cross the highways after dark, so the stickers will hopefully help drivers see this shining thing crossing the highway, and maybe they will slow down a little bit
 We don't know
 We'll see if it will reduce the amount of tapir roadkill
 But the point is, maybe this is the kind of stuff that needs to be done
And although I'm struggling with all these questions in my mind right now, I have a pact with tapirs
 I know in my heart that tapir conservation is my cause
 This is my passion
 I have this huge network of supporters behind me, and there is no way I'm ever going to stop
 I will continue doing this, most probably for the rest of my life
 And I'll keep doing this for Patrícia, my namesake, one of the first tapirs we captured and monitored in the Atlantic Forest many, many years ago; for Rita and her baby Vincent in the Pantanal
 And I'll keep doing this for Ted, a baby tapir we captured in December last year also in the Pantanal
And I will keep doing this for the hundreds of tapirs that I've had the pleasure to meet over the years and the many others I know I will encounter in the future
 They need me
 And you know? We human beings deserve to live in a world where we can get out there and see and benefit from not only tapirs but all the other beautiful species, now and in the future
Thank you so much
 But there's one story that keeps me awake at night, and it's about Doaa
A Syrian refugee, 19 years old, she was living a grinding existence in Egypt working day wages
 Her dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back in Syria that had been blown to pieces by a bomb
 And the war that drove them there was still raging in its fourth year
 And the community that once welcomed them there had become weary of them
 And one day, men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her
 Once an aspiring student thinking only of her future, now she was scared all the time
But she was also full of hope, because she was in love with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem
 Bassem was also struggling in Egypt, and he said to Doaa, "Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety
 I will work, you can study -- the promise of a new life
" And he asked her father for her hand in marriage
But they knew to get to Europe they had to risk their lives, traveling across the Mediterranean Sea, putting their hands in smugglers', notorious for their cruelty
 And Doaa was terrified of the water
 She always had been
 She never learned to swim
It was August that year, and already 2,000 people had died trying to cross the Mediterranean, but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it all the way to Northern Europe, and she thought, "Maybe we can, too
" So she asked her parents if they could go, and after a painful discussion, they consented, and Bassem paid his entire life savings -- 2,500 dollars each -- to the smugglers
 They were taken then by small boats onto an old fishing boat, 500 of them crammed onto that boat, 300 below, 500 above
 There were Syrians, Palestinians, Africans, Muslims and Christians, 100 children, including Sandra -- little Sandra, six years old -- and Masa, 18 months
 Doaa was sitting with her legs crammed up to her chest, Bassem holding her hand
Day three, Doaa had a premonition
 And she said to Bassem, "I fear we're not going to make it
 We will make it to Sweden, we will get married and we will have a future
"
Day four, the passengers were getting agitated
 They asked the captain, "When will we get there?" He told them to shut up, and he insulted them
 He said, "In 16 hours we will reach the shores of Italy
" They were weak and weary
 Soon they saw a boat approach -- a smaller boat, 10 men on board, who started shouting at them, hurling insults, throwing sticks, asking them to all disembark and get on this smaller, more unseaworthy boat
 The parents were terrified for their children, and they collectively refused to disembark
 So the boat sped away in anger, and a half an hour later, came back and started deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat, just below where she and Bassem were sitting
 And she heard how they yelled, "Let the fish eat your flesh!" And they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank
The 300 people below deck were doomed
 Doaa was holding on to the side of the boat as it sank, and watched in horror as a small child was cut to pieces by the propeller
 Bassem said to her, "Please let go, or you'll be swept in and the propeller will kill you, too
" And remember -- she can't swim
 But she let go and she started moving her arms and her legs, thinking, "This is swimming
" And miraculously, Bassem found a life ring
 It was one of those child's rings that they use to play in swimming pools and on calm seas
 And Doaa climbed onto the ring, her arms and her legs dangling by the side
 Around them there were corpses
 But when a day went by and no one came, some people gave up hope, and Doaa and Bassem watched as men in the distance took their life vests off and sank into the water
One man approached them with a small baby perched on his shoulder, nine months old -- Malek
 He was holding onto a gas canister to stay afloat, and he said to them, "I fear I am not going to survive
 I don't have the courage anymore
 So now they were three, Doaa, Bassem and little Malek
And let me take a pause in this story right here and ask the question: why do refugees like Doaa take these kinds of risks? Millions of refugees are living in exile, in limbo
 They're living in countries [fleeing] from a war that has been raging for four years
 Even if they wanted to return, they can't
 Their homes, their businesses, their towns and their cities have been completely destroyed
 This is a UNESCO World Heritage City, Homs, in Syria
 So people continue to flee into neighboring countries, and we build refugee camps for them in the desert
 Hundreds of thousands of people live in camps like these, and thousands and thousands more, millions, live in towns and cities
 And the communities, the neighboring countries that once welcomed them with open arms and hearts are overwhelmed
 There are simply not enough schools, water systems, sanitation
 Even rich European countries could never handle such an influx without massive investment
 The Syria war has driven almost four million people over the borders, but over seven million people are on the run inside the country
 That means that over half the Syrian population has been forced to flee
 Back to those neighboring countries hosting so many
 They feel that the richer world has done too little to support them
 And days have turned into months, months into years
 A refugee's stay is supposed to be temporary
Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water
 It was their second day, and Bassem was getting very weak
 And now it was Doaa's turn to say to Bassem, "My love, please hold on to hope, to our future
 We will make it
" And he said to her, "I'm sorry, my love, that I put you in this situation
 I have never loved anyone as much as I love you
" And he released himself into the water, and Doaa watched as the love of her life drowned before her eyes
Later that day, a mother came up to Doaa with her small 18-month-old daughter, Masa
 This was the little girl I showed you in the picture earlier, with the life vests
 And she said to Doaa, "Please take this child
 Let her be part of you
 And they were thirsty and they were hungry and they were agitated, and she tried her best to amuse them, to sing to them, to say words to them from the Quran
 Around them, the bodies were bloating and turning black
 The sun was blazing during the day
 At night, there was a cold moon and fog
 It was very frightening
 On the fourth day in the water, this is how Doaa probably looked on the ring with her two children
A woman came on the fourth day and approached her and asked her to take another child -- a little boy, just four years old
Later that day, she looked up into the sky with hope, because she saw two planes crossing in the sky
 And she waved her arms, hoping they would see her, but the planes were soon gone
But that afternoon, as the sun was going down, she saw a boat, a merchant vessel
" She waved her arms and she felt like she shouted for about two hours
 And it had become dark, but finally the searchlights found her and they extended a rope, astonished to see a woman clutching onto two babies
They pulled them onto the boat, they got oxygen and blankets, and a Greek helicopter came to pick them up and take them to the island of Crete
But Doaa looked down and asked, "What of Malek?" And they told her the little baby did not survive -- she drew her last breath in the boat's clinic
 But Doaa was sure that as they had been pulled up onto the rescue boat, that little baby girl had been smiling
Only 11 people survived that wreck, of the 500
 There was never an international investigation into what happened
 There were some media reports about mass murder at sea, a terrible tragedy, but that was only for one day
 And then the news cycle moved on
Meanwhile, in a pediatric hospital on Crete, little Masa was on the edge of death
 Her kidneys were failing
 Her glucose levels were dangerously low
 My colleagues also visited and said pretty words to her in Arabic
 Amazingly, little Masa survived
And soon the Greek press started reporting about the miracle baby, who had survived four days in the water without food or anything to drink, and offers to adopt her came from all over the country
And meanwhile, Doaa was in another hospital on Crete, thin, dehydrated
 An Egyptian family took her into their home as soon as she was released
 And soon word went around about Doaa's survival, and a phone number was published on Facebook
 Messages started coming in
"Doaa, do you know what happened to my brother? My sister? My parents? My friends? Do you know if they survived?"
One of those messages said, "I believe you saved my little niece, Masa
 This was from Masa's uncle, a Syrian refugee who had made it to Sweden with his family and also Masa's older sister
 Soon, we hope, Masa will be reunited with him in Sweden, and until then, she's being cared for in a beautiful orphanage in Athens
And Doaa? Well, word went around about her survival, too
 And the media wrote about this slight woman, and couldn't imagine how she could survive all this time under such conditions in that sea, and still save another life
 The Academy of Athens, one of Greece's most prestigious institutions, gave her an award of bravery, and she deserves all that praise, and she deserves a second chance
 But she wants to still go to Sweden
 She wants to bring her mother and her father and her younger siblings away from Egypt there as well, and I believe she will succeed
 She is an extraordinary survivor
 Why not now? Why is there so little investment in the neighboring countries hosting so many refugees? And why, the root question, is so little being done to stop the wars, the persecution and the poverty that is driving so many people to the shores of Europe? Until these issues are resolved, people will continue to take to the seas and to seek safety and asylum
And what happens next? Well, that is largely Europe's choice
 People are worried about their security, their economies, the changes of culture
 But is that more important than saving human lives? Because there is something fundamental here that I think overrides the rest, and it is about our common humanity
 No person fleeing war or persecution should have to die crossing a sea to reach safety
One thing is for sure, that no refugee would be on those dangerous boats if they could thrive where they are
 And no migrant would take that dangerous journey if they had enough food for themselves and their children
 And no one would put their life savings in the hands of those notorious smugglers if there was a legal way to migrate
Thank you
A girl I've never met before changed my life and the life of thousands of other people
 I'm the CEO of DoSomething
org
 It's one of the largest organizations in the world for young people
 In fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts in the United States
 And we're not homophobic
And it's true -- the way we communicate with young people is by text, because that's how young people communicate
 And we'll text them
 And we'll have a 97 percent open rate
 It'll over-index Hispanic and urban
 We collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter and over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards
 This is big scale
 OK --
But there's one weird side effect
 Every time we send out a text message, we get back a few dozen text messages having nothing to do with peanut butter or hunger or senior citizens -- but text messages about being bullied, text messages about being addicted to pot
 And the worst message we ever got said exactly this: "He won't stop raping me
 It's my dad
 He told me not to tell anyone
 Are you there?"
We couldn't believe this was happening
 We couldn't believe that something so horrific could happen to a human being, and that she would share it with us -- something so intimate, so personal
 So we launched Crisis Text Line, very quietly, in Chicago and El Paso -- just a few thousand people in each market
 And in four months, we were in all 295 area codes in America
 Just to put that into perspective, that's zero marketing and faster growth than when Facebook first launched
Text is unbelievably private
 No one hears you talking
 So we spike everyday at lunch time -- kids are sitting at the lunch table and you think that she's texting the cute boy across the hall, but she's actually texting us about her bulimia
 We just get facts
We get things like, "I want to die
" And so the crisis counselor says, "How about you put those pills in the drawer while we text?" And they go back and forth for a while
 And the crisis counselor gets the girl to give her her address, because if you're texting a text line, you want help
 So she gets the address and the counselor triggers an active rescue while they're texting back and forth
 And then it goes quiet -- 23 minutes with no response from this girl
 And the next message that comes in says -- it's the mom -- "I had no idea, and I was in the house, we're in an ambulance on our way to the hospital
 "I just got out of the hospital
 I was diagnosed as bipolar, and I think I'm going to be OK
"
I would love to tell you that that's an unusual exchange, but we're doing on average 2
41 active rescues a day
 The beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line is that these are strangers counseling other strangers on the most intimate issues, and getting them from hot moments to cold moments
 It's exciting, and I will tell you that we have done a total of more than 6
5 million text messages in less than two years
But the thing that really gets me hot and sweaty about this, the thing that really gets me psyched is the data: 6
5 million messages -- that's the volume, velocity and variety to provide a really juicy corpus
 We can do things like predictive work
 We can do all kinds of conclusions and learnings from that data set
 So we can be better, and the world can be better
How do you know that person's any good? Oh, they have a degree from Harvard on the wall? Are you sure he didn't graduate in the bottom 10 percent?
When my husband and I saw a marriage counselor, I thought she was a genius when she said, "I'll see you guys in two weeks -- but I need to see you next week, sir
"
We have the data to know what makes a great counselor
 We know that if you text the words "numbs" and "sleeve," there's a 99 percent match for cutting
 We know that if you text in the words "mg" and "rubber band," there's a 99 percent match for substance abuse
 And we know that if you text in "sex," "oral" and "Mormon," you're questioning if you're gay
 Now that's interesting information that a counselor could figure out but that algorithm in our hands means that an automatic pop-up says, "99 percent match for cutting -- try asking one of these questions" to prompt the counselor
 Or "99 percent match for substance abuse, here are three drug clinics near the texter
" It makes us more accurate
On the day that Robin Williams committed suicide, people flooded hotlines all over this country
 It was sad to see an icon, a funnyman, commit suicide, and there were three hour wait times on every phone hotline in the country
 We had a spike in volume also
 The difference was if you text us, "I want to die," or "I want to kill myself," the algorithm reads that, you're code orange, and you become number one in the queue
 So we can handle severity, not chronological
This data is also making the world better because I'm sitting on the world's first map of real-time crises
5 million messages, auto-tagging through natural language processes, all of these data points -- I can tell you that the worst day of the week for eating disorders: Monday
 We've pulled all the personally identifiable information
 And it's in a place called CrisisTrends
org
 Because I want schools to be able to see that Monday is the worst day for eating disorders, so that they can plan meals and guidance counselors to be there on Mondays
 And I want families to see that substance abuse questions spike at 5am
 I want somebody to take care of those Native American reservations in Montana
 I don't think of myself as a mental health activist
 Yeah, that sounded too girly
 I'm nerdy
I love data
 And the only difference really between me and those people in hoodies down the road with their fat-funded companies, is that I'm not inspired by helping you find Chinese food at 2am in Dallas, or helping you touch your wrist and get a car immediately, or swipe right and get laid
 I'm inspired --
I want to use tech and data to make the world a better place
 Because the truth is we never heard from her again
 And I hope that she is somewhere safe and healthy, and I hope that she sees this talk and she knows that her desperation and her courage inspired the creation of Crisis Text Line and inspires me every freaking day
A few years ago, I broke into my own house
 I had just driven home, it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter, I had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town, and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees -- and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit, minus 40 is where the two scales meet -- it was very cold
 In fact, I could see them through the window, lying on the dining room table where I had left them
 So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows, and they were locked tight
 I thought about calling a locksmith -- at least I had my cellphone, but at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up, and it was cold
 I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase
So, desperate and freezing cold, I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window, cleared out the shards of glass, I crawled through, I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening, figuring that in the morning, on the way to the airport, I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it
 This was going to be expensive, but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith, so I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even
Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress
 It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate, it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking
 So the next morning, when I woke up on too little sleep, worrying about the hole in the window, and a mental note that I had to call my contractor, and the freezing temperatures, and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe, and, you know, with all the cortisol in my brain, my thinking was cloudy, but I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy
And it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter, that I realized I didn't have my passport
So I raced home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes, got my passport, raced back to the airport, I made it just in time, but they had given away my seat to someone else, so I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms, in a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight
 Well, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep
 So I started thinking about that, but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later
 I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner, and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window, and, you know, forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight
It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein, who had written about it a few years before, also called the pre-mortem
 Now, you all know what the postmortem is
 I'll start with the obvious ones
Around the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost
 Now, this sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science to back this up, based on the way our spatial memory works
 There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus, that evolved over tens of thousands of years, to keep track of the locations of important things -- where the well is, where fish can be found, that stand of fruit trees, where the friendly and enemy tribes live
 The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged
 It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts
 And if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels, and they could still find their nuts
 They weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus, this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things
 But it's really good for things that don't move around much, not so good for things that move around
 So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports
 So in the home, designate a spot for your keys -- a hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl
 For your passport, a particular drawer
 For your reading glasses, a particular table
What about travel? Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards, your driver's license, your passport, mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud
 If these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement
Now these are some rather obvious things
 Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking
 So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best, and you should put systems in place
And there's perhaps no more stressful a situation than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make
And so I want to talk about that
 And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says, "I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high
" Now, you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke
 And so you're thinking having high cholesterol isn't the best thing, and so the doctor says, "You know, I'd like to give you a drug that will help you lower your cholesterol, a statin
" And you've probably heard of statins, you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today, you probably even know people who take them
But there's a question you should ask at this point, a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don't like talking about, and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less
 It's for the number needed to treat
 And you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that? The number should be one
 My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me if it's not going to help
 But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way
 And it's not the doctor's fault, if it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me
 We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough
 But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people
 This is according to research by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband, independently confirmed by Bloomberg
com
 300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented
Now you're probably thinking, "Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol
" But you should ask at this point for another statistic, and that is, "Tell me about the side effects
" Right? So for this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients
 And they include terrible things -- debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress -- but now you're thinking, "Five percent, not very likely it's going to happen to me, I'll still take the drug
" But wait a minute
 Remember under stress you're not thinking clearly
 So think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time, so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot
 300 people take the drug, right? One person's helped, five percent of those 300 have side effects, that's 15 people
 You're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug
Now, I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not
 I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor
 Medical ethics requires it, it's part of the principle of informed consent
 You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not
Now you might be thinking I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value, but in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat
 For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50, removal of the prostate for cancer, the number needed to treat is 49
 They include impotence, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing, fecal incontinence
So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward
 You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot
 And you also want to think about things like quality of life
 Because you have a choice oftentimes, do you I want a shorter life that's pain-free, or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end? These are things to talk about and think about now, with your family and your loved ones
 You might change your mind in the heat of the moment, but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking
Remember, our brain under stress releases cortisol, and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down
 There's an evolutionary reason for this
 Face-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system, or your libido, or your immune system, because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things and you don't react quickly, you might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter
 Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational, logical thinking, as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown
 So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations
I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed
 We all are going to fail now and then
 The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be, to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place
Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal, when I got back from my trip, I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door, with a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combination
 So I'm not completely organized, but I see organization as a gradual process, and I'm getting there
A year ago, we were invited by the Swiss Embassy in Berlin to present our art projects
 It is the only old building in the government district that was not destroyed during the Second World War, and it sits right next to the Federal Chancellery
Although Germany is an advanced democracy, citizens are limited in their constitutional rights in its government district
 And this is interesting from an artistic point of view
 The opportunities to exercise participation and to express oneself are always bound to a certain order and always subject to a specific regulation
 With an awareness of the dependencies of these regulations, we can gain a new perspective
 The given terms and conditions shape our perception, our actions and our lives
And this is crucial in another context
 The antennas of the British GCHQ are hidden in a white cylindrical radome, while the listening post of the American NSA is covered by radio transparent screens
But how to address these hidden and disguised forces? With my colleague, Christoph Wachter, we accepted the invitation of the Swiss Embassy
 And we used this opportunity to exploit the specific situation
On the roof of the Swiss Embassy, we installed a series of antennas
 They weren't as sophisticated as those used by the Americans and the British
They were makeshift can antennas, not camouflaged but totally obvious and visible
 The Academy of Arts joined the project, and so we built another large antenna on their rooftop, exactly between the listening posts of the NSA and the GCHQ
Never have we been observed in such detail while building an art installation
 A helicopter circled over our heads with a camera registering each and every move we made, and on the roof of the US Embassy, security officers patrolled
 Although the government district is governed by a strict police order, there are no specific laws relating to digital communication
 We named the project "Can You Hear Me?"
The antennas created an open and free Wi-Fi communication network in which anyone who wanted to would be able to participate using any Wi-Fi-enabled device without any hindrance, and be able to send messages to those listening on the frequencies that were being intercepted
 And people did communicate
 Over 15,000 messages were sent
 Here are some examples
"Hello world, hello Berlin, hello NSA, hello GCHQ
"
"NSA Agents, Do the Right Thing! Blow the whistle!"
"This is the NSA
 In God we trust
 All others we track!!!!!"
"#@nonymous is watching #NSA #GCHQ - we are part of your organizations
 We will #shutdown"
"This is the NSA's Achilles heel
 Open Networks
"
"Agents, what twisted story of yourself will you tell your grandchildren?"
"Make Love, Not cyberwar
"
We invited the embassies and the government departments to participate in the open network, too, and to our surprise, they did
 Files appeared on the network, including classified documents leaked from the parliamentary investigation commission, which highlights that the free exchange and discussion of vital information is starting to become difficult, even for members of a parliament
 We also organized guided tours to experience and sound out the power constellations on-site
 The tours visited the restricted zones around the embassies, and we discussed the potential and the highlights of communication
Let's look at an actual example
 The fate of people living in the makeshift settlements on the outskirts of Paris is hidden and faded from view
 It's a vicious circle
 It's not poverty, not racism, not exclusion that are new
 What is new is how these realities are hidden and how people are made invisible in an age of global and overwhelming communication and exchange
 Such makeshift settlements are considered illegal, and therefore those living in them don't have a chance of making their voices heard
 On the contrary, every time they appear, every time they risk becoming visible, merely gives grounds for further persecution, expulsion and suppression
 What interested us was how we could come to know this hidden side
 It's not a digital interface, but a physical one: it's a hotel
We named the project "Hotel Gelem
 These are real hotels
 People can stay there
 They are a symbol
 You can go online and ask for a personal invitation to come and live for a few days in the Hotel Gelem, in their homes, eating, working and living with the Roma families
 Here, the Roma families are not the travelers; the visitors are
 Here, the Roma families are not a minority; the visitors are
The point is not to make judgments, but rather to find out about the context that determines these disparate and seemingly insurmountable contradictions
 In the world of globalization, the continents are drifting closer to each other
 Cultures, goods and people are in permanent exchange, but at the same time, the gap between the world of the privileged and the world of the excluded is growing
We were recently in Australia
 For us, it was no problem to enter the country
 We have European passports, visas and air tickets
 But asylum seekers who arrive by boat in Australia are deported or taken to prison
 The interception of the boats and the disappearance of the people into the detention system are veiled by the Australian authorities
 These procedures are declared to be secret military operations
 After dramatic escapes from crisis zones and war zones, men, women and children are detained by Australia without trial, sometimes for years
During our stay, however, we managed to reach out and work with asylum seekers who were imprisoned, despite strict screening and isolation
 From these contexts was born an installation in the art space of the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane
On the face of it, it was a very simple installation
 But the exhibition step came in the form of connectivity
 Above every floor marking, there was a headset
 Visitors were offered the opportunity to talk directly to a refugee who was or had been imprisoned in a specific detention facility and engage in a personal conversation
 In the protected context of the art exhibition, asylum seekers felt free to talk about themselves, their story and their situation, without fear of consequences
 Visitors immersed themselves in long conversations about families torn apart, about dramatic escapes from war zones, about suicide attempts, about the fate of children in detention
 Emotions ran deep
 Many wept
Europe is now facing a stream of migrants
 The situation for the asylum seekers is made worse by contradictory policies and the temptation of militarized responses
 We have also established communication systems in remote refugee centers in Switzerland and Greece
 They are all about providing basic information -- medical costs, legal information, guidance
 But they are significant
 Information on the Internet that could ensure survival along dangerous routes is being censored, and the provision of such information is becoming increasingly criminalized
This brings us back to our network and to the antennas on the roof of the Swiss Embassy in Berlin and the "Can You Hear Me?" project
 We should not take it for granted to be boundlessly connected
 We should start making our own connections, fighting for this idea of an equal and globally interconnected world
 This is essential to overcome our speechlessness and the separation provoked by rival political forces
 It is only in truly exposing ourselves to the transformative power of this experience that we can overcome prejudice and exclusion
Thank you
 Thank you, Mathias
 The other half of your artistic duo is also here
 Christoph Wachter, come onstage
First, tell me just a detail: the name of the hotel is not a random name
 Gelem means something specific in the Roma language
 Yes, "Gelem, Gelem" is the title of the Romani hymn, the official, and it means "I went a long way
"
 That's just to add the detail to your talk
 But you two traveled to the island of Lesbos very recently, you're just back a couple of days ago, in Greece, where thousands of refugees are arriving and have been arriving over the last few months
 What did you see there and what did you do there?
 Well, Lesbos is one of the Greek islands close to Turkey, and during our stay, many asylum seekers arrived by boat on overcrowded dinghies, and after landing, they were left completely on their own
 They are denied many services
 For example, they are not allowed to buy a bus ticket or to rent a hotel room, so many families literally sleep in the streets
 And we installed networks there to allow basic communication, because I think, I believe, it's not only that we have to speak about the refugees, I think we need to start talking to them
 And by doing so, we can realize that it is about human beings, about their lives and their struggle to survive
 Christoph, thank you for coming to TED
 Mathias, thank you for coming to TED and sharing your story
 It means to play softly
 If you're playing a musical instrument and you notice a "p" in the score, you need to play softer
 Two p's -- even softer
 Four p's -- extremely soft
 This is my drawing of a p-tree, which demonstrates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p's there may be, you'll never reach complete silence
 That's my current definition of silence: a very obscure sound
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of American Sign Language, ASL, plus a bit of my own background
 So it has a history of about 200 years
I was born deaf, and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life
 And I believed it to be true
 Sound was very much a part of my life, really, on my mind every day
 As a Deaf person living in a world of sound, it's as if I was living in a foreign country, blindly following its rules, customs, behaviors and norms without ever questioning them
So how is it that I understand sound? Well, I watch how people behave and respond to sound
 I learn and mirror that behavior
 Thus I've learned, for example 
 "Don't slam the door!" "Don't make too much noise when you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"
" All of these things I term "sound etiquette
" Maybe I think about sound etiquette more than the average hearing person does
 I'm hyper-vigilant around sound
 And I'm always waiting in eager nervous anticipation around sound, about what's to come next
Hence, this drawing
 TBD, to be decided
 TBA, to be announced
 And you notice the staff -- there are no notes contained in the lines
 That's because the lines already contain sound through the subtle smudges and smears
In Deaf culture, movement is equivalent to sound
 This is a sign for "staff" in ASL
 A typical staff contains five lines
 Prior to this time, I had been working as a painter
 At that time, sound was trending, and this struck me 
Now sound has come into my art territory
 Is it going to further distance me from art? I realized that doesn't have to be the case at all
 I actually know sound
 I know it so well that it doesn't have to be something just experienced through the ears
 It could be felt tactually, or experienced as a visual, or even as an idea
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound and to put it into my art practice
 And everything that I had been taught regarding sound, I decided to do away with and unlearn
 I started creating a new body of work
 And when I presented this to the art community, I was blown away with the amount of support and attention I received
 I realized: sound is like money, power, control -- social currency
 In the back of my mind, I've always felt that sound was your thing, a hearing person's thing
 I chose to be empowered
 And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, in society's eyes it's as if I don't have a voice at all
 So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice
 And that way, I'm able to maintain relevancy in society today
So at school, at work and institutions, I work with many different ASL interpreters
 And their voice becomes my voice and identity
 They help me to be heard
 And their voices hold value and currency
 Ironically, by borrowing out their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of currency, kind of like taking out a loan with a very high interest rate
 If I didn't continue this practice, I feel that I could just fade off into oblivion and not maintain any form of social currency
So with sound as my new art medium, I delved into the world of music
 And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and ASL
 For example, a musical note cannot be fully captured and expressed on paper
 And the same holds true for a concept in ASL
 They're both highly spatial and highly inflected -- meaning that subtle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds
I'd like to share with you a piano metaphor, to have you have a better understanding of how ASL works
 So, envision a piano
 If you assign a different parameter to each finger as you play the piano -- such as facial expression, body movement, speed, hand shape and so on, as you play the piano -- English is a linear language, as if one key is being pressed at a time
 However, ASL is more like a chord -- all 10 fingers need to come down simultaneously to express a clear concept or idea in ASL
 In ASL, by playing around with these different grammatical parameters, you can express different ideas
For example, take the sign TO-LOOK-AT
 This is the sign TO-LOOK-AT
 I'm looking at you
 Staring at you
Uh-oh
 What are you looking at? Aw, stop
I then started thinking, "What if I was to look at ASL through a musical lens?" If I was to create a sign and repeat it over and over, it could become like a piece of visual music
 For example, this is the sign for "day," as the sun rises and sets
 This is "all day
" If I was to repeat it and slow it down, visually it looks like a piece of music
 All 
 day
 I feel the same holds true for "all night
" "All night
" This is ALL-NIGHT, represented in this drawing
 And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of nights: "last night," "overnight,"  "all night long
I feel like the third one has a lot more musicality than the other two
This represents how time is expressed in ASL and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time
 For example, 1H is one hand, 2H is two hand, present tense happens closest and in front of the body, future is in front of the body and the past is to your back
"
 Yet when I see the word "common time," what automatically comes to mind for me is "at the same time
" So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand
 We have the staff across the head and the chest
 RH, Flash claw]
[Common time]
 LH, Flash claw]
I'm now going to demonstrate a hand shape called the "flash claw
" Can you please follow along with me? Everybody, hands up
 Yes, got it
 That means "to fall in love" in International [Sign]
The second one I'd like to demonstrate is this -- please follow along with me again
 This is "colonization" in ASL
Now the third -- please follow along again
 So let's do all three together
 "Fall in love," "colonization" and "enlightenment
" Good job, everyone
Notice how all three signs are very similar, they all happen at the head and the chest, but they convey quite different meanings
So it's amazing to see how ASL is alive and thriving, just like music is
 However, in this day and age, we live in a very audio-centric world
 And just because ASL has no sound to it, it automatically holds no social currency
 We need to start thinking harder about what defines social currency and allow ASL to develop its own form of currency -- without sound
 And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclusive society
 And maybe people will understand that you don't need to be deaf to learn ASL, nor do you have to be hearing to learn music
ASL is such a rich treasure that I'd like you to have the same experience
 And I'd like to invite you to open your ears, to open your eyes, take part in our culture and experience our visual language
 And you never know, you might just fall in love with us
Thank you
Denise Kahler-Braaten: Hey, that's me
When I was a kid, my parents would tell me, "You can make a mess, but you have to clean up after yourself
" So freedom came with responsibility
 So I grew up in a bubble of innocence -- or a bubble of ignorance, I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the ugly truth
 And growing up, I found out that adults make a mess, and they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves
Fast forward, I am an adult now, and I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong Harbour School
 So as good citizens, we clean up the beaches -- and no, he is not drinking alcohol, and if he is, I did not give it to him
And so it's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them
 It's a horrifying fact
 And in past decades, we've been taking those big ships out and those big nets, and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope, and we sort them, and then we put this data onto a map
 But that takes forever, it's very expensive, and so it's quite risky to take those big boats out
So with my students, ages six to 15, we've been dreaming of inventing a better way
 And let me tell you, kids with power tools are awesome and safe
Not really
 We collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small because it breaks down
 And so this is how we work
 I let the imaginations of my students run wild
 And my job is to try to collect the best of each kid's idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work
 And so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits, we are going to collect only the data
 And the next thing we do -- we do what we call "rapid prototyping
" We are so rapid at prototyping that the lunch is still in the lunchbox when we're hacking it
 So we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor, and the computer on board will process this image, and measure the size of each particle, so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water
So we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors called Instructables, in the hope that somebody would make it even better
What was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem, and boom -- they are trying to immediately address it
[I can investigate my local problem]
 And they watch the news, they watch the Internet, and they came across this image
 This was a child, probably under 10, cleaning up an oil spill bare-handed, in the Sundarbans, which is the world's largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh
 So they were very shocked, because this is the water they drink, this is the water they bathe in, this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live
 But, there's a technology that's rather simple, that's called spectrometry, that allows you see what's in the water
 So we built a rough prototype of a spectrometer, and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums, so that can help you identify what's in the water
 So we packed this prototype of a sensor, and we shipped it to Bangladesh
[I can investigate a remote problem]
So I was very compelled by doing the second experiments, and I wanted to take it even further -- maybe addressing an even harder problem, and it's also closer to my heart
 More than 14,000 people died in an instant
 Also, it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, the nuclear power plant just by the water
 And today, I read the reports and an average of 300 tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean
 And today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of cesium-137
 If you go outside on the West Coast, you can measure Fukushima everywhere
 But if you look at the map, it can look like most of the radioactivity has been washed away from the Japanese coast, and most of it is now -- it looks like it's safe, it's blue
 Well, reality is a bit more complicated than this
 So of course we didn't take the kids, the parents wouldn't allow that to happen
But every night we would report to "Mission Control" -- different masks they're wearing
 It could look like they didn't take the work seriously, but they really did because they're going to have to live with radioactivity their whole life
 And so what we did with them is that we'd discuss the data we collected that day, and talk about where we should be going next -- strategy, itinerary, etc
 And so we built the elevation map, we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity, and we sprayed water to simulate the rainfall
 And with this we could see that the radioactive dust was washing from the top of the mountain into the river system, and leaking into the ocean
 So it was a rough estimate
But with this in mind, we organized this expedition, which was the closest civilians have been to the nuclear power plant
 We are sailing 1
 We pack the sediment into small bags, we then dispatch them to hundreds of small bags that we send to different universities, and we produce the map of the seabed radioactivity, especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce, and I will hope that we will have improved the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi
You can see a progression here -- we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem
 And it's been super exciting to work at these different scales, with also very simple, open-source technologies
 But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done
 We haven't even started to try to solve the problems
 It's in central Hong Kong, and it's a place we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a bit of biology, a bit of optics, basically you can build pretty much everything there
 And its a place where adults and kids can play together
 It's a place where kids' dreams can come true, with the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again
 Acceleration! Acceleration!
 We're asking questions such as, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy? For example
 Or, can we help the mobility of the aging population by transforming very standard wheelchairs into cool, electric vehicles?
So plastic, oil and radioactivity are horrible, horrible legacies, but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children is lies
 We can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions
So citizen scientists, makers, dreamers -- we must prepare the next generation that cares about the environment and people, and that can actually do something about it
Thank you
I want to tell you three stories about the power of relationships to solve the deep and complex social problems of this century
You know, sometimes it seems like all these problems of poverty, inequality, ill health, unemployment, violence, addiction -- they're right there in one person's life
 So I want to tell you about someone like this that I know
 I'm going to call her Ella
 Ella lives in a British city on a run down estate
 The shops are closed, the pub's gone, the playground's pretty desolate and never used, and inside Ella's house, the tension is palpable and the noise levels are deafening
 The TV's on at full volume
 One of her sons is fighting with one of her daughters
 Ella is stuck
 She has lived with crisis for 40 years
 She knows nothing else, and she knows no way out
 She's had a whole series of abusive partners, and, tragically, one of her children has been taken into care by social services
 The three children that still live with her suffer from a whole range of problems, and none of them are in education
 And Ella says to me that she is repeating the cycle of her own mother's life before her
But when I met Ella, there were 73 different services on offer for her and her family in the city where she lives, 73 different services run out of 24 departments in one city, and Ella and her partners and her children were known to most of them
 And the family home was visited on a regular basis by social workers, youth workers, a health officer, a housing officer, a home tutor and the local policemen
 And the governments say that there are 100,000 families in Britain today like Ella's, struggling to break the cycle of economic, social and environmental deprivation
 And they also say that managing this problem costs a quarter of a million pounds per family per year and yet nothing changes
 None of these well-meaning visitors are making a difference
This is a chart we made in the same city with another family like Ella's
 And just as with Ella, not one of these interventions is part of an overall plan
 There's no end goal in sight
 None of the interventions are dealing with the underlying issues
 These are just containment measures, ways of managing a problem
 One of the policemen says to me, "Look, I just deliver the message and then I leave
So, I've spent time living with families like Ella's in different parts of the world, because I want to know: what can we learn from places where our social institutions just aren't working? I want to know what it feels like to live in Ella's family
Well, the first thing I learned is that cost is a really slippery concept
 Because when the government says that a family like Ella's costs a quarter of a million pounds a year to manage, what it really means is that this system costs a quarter of a million pounds a year
 Instead, the system is just like this costly gyroscope that spins around the families, keeping them stuck at its heart, exactly where they are
And I also spent time with the frontline workers, and I learned that it is an impossible situation
 So he says to Ryan, "How often have you been smoking? Have you been drinking? When did you go to school?" And this kind of interaction rules out the possibility of a normal conversation
 It rules out the possibility of what's needed to build a relationship between Tom and Ryan
When we made this chart, the frontline workers, the professionals -- they stared at it absolutely amazed
 It snaked around the walls of their offices
 So many hours, so well meant, but ultimately so futile
 And there was this moment of absolute breakdown, and then of clarity: we had to work in a different way
So in a really brave step, the leaders of the city where Ella lives agreed that we could start by reversing Ryan's ratio
 So everyone who came into contact with Ella or a family like Ella's would spend 80 percent of their time working with the families and only 20 percent servicing the system
 And even more radically, the families would lead and they would decide who was in a best position to help them
 So Ella and another mother were asked to be part of an interview panel, to choose from amongst the existing professionals who would work with them
 And many, many people wanted to join us, because you don't go into this kind of work to manage a system, you go in because you can and you want to make a difference
So Ella and the mother asked everybody who came through the door, "What will you do when my son starts kicking me?" And so the first person who comes in says, "Well, I'll look around for the nearest exit and I will back out very slowly, and if the noise is still going on, I'll call my supervisor
" And the mothers go, "You're the system
 Get out of here!" And then the next person who comes is a policeman, and he says, "Well, I'll tackle your son to the ground and then I'm not sure what I'll do
" So, they chose professionals who confessed they didn't necessarily have the answers, who said -- well, they weren't going to talk in jargon
 They showed their human qualities and convinced the mothers that they would stick with them through thick and thin, even though they wouldn't be soft with them
So these new teams and the families were then given a sliver of the former budget, but they could spend the money in any way they chose
 And so one of the families went out for supper
 They went to McDonald's and they sat down and they talked and they listened for the first time in a long time
 Another family asked the team if they would help them do up their home
 And one mother took the money and she used it as a float to start a social enterprise
And in a really short space of time, something new started to grow: a relationship between the team and the workers
 And then some remarkable changes took place
 Maybe it's not surprising that the journey for Ella has had some big steps backwards as well as forwards
 They've made some new friendships
 And all the same people have been involved in this transformation -- same families, same workers
 But the relationship between them has been supported to change
So I'm telling you about Ella because I think that relationships are the critical resource we have in solving some of these intractable problems
 But today, our relationships are all but written off by our politics, our social policies, our welfare institutions
 And I've learned that this really has to change
So what do I mean by relationships? I'm talking about the simple human bonds between us, a kind of authentic sense of connection, of belonging, the bonds that make us happy, that support us to change, to be brave like Ella and try something new
 And, you know, it's no accident that those who run and work in the institutions that are supposed to support Ella and her family don't talk about relationships, because relationships are expressly designed out of a welfare model that was drawn up in Britain and exported around the world
 Instead, they trusted this idea of the impersonal system and the bureaucrat who would be detached and work in this system
 And the impact of Beveridge on the way the modern state sees social issues just can't be underestimated
 The Beveridge Report sold over 100,000 copies in the first weeks of publication alone
 People queued in the rain on a November night to get hold of a copy, and it was read across the country, across the colonies, across Europe, across the United States of America, and it had this huge impact on the way that welfare states were designed around the globe
 The cultures, the bureaucracies, the institutions -- they are global, and they've come to seem like common sense
 They've become so ingrained in us, that actually we don't even see them anymore
 And I think it's really important to say that in the 20th century, they were remarkably successful, these institutions
 But at the same time, Beveridge sowed the seeds of today's challenges
So let me tell you a second story
 What do you think today is a bigger killer than a lifetime of smoking? It's loneliness
 According to government statistics, one person over 60 -- one in three -- doesn't speak to or see another person in a week
 One person in 10, that's 850,000 people, doesn't speak to anyone else in a month
 And we're not the only people with this problem; this problem touches the whole of the Western world
 And it's even more acute in countries like China, where a process of rapid urbanization, mass migration, has left older people alone in the villages
 And so the services that Beveridge designed and exported -- they can't address this kind of problem
 Loneliness is like a collective relational challenge, and it can't be addressed by a traditional bureaucratic response
So some years ago, wanting to understand this problem, I started to work with a group of about 60 older people in South London, where I live
 I wanted to know what we could do differently
 And if you ask them, people tell you they want two things
 They want somebody to go up a ladder and change a light bulb, or to be there when they come out of hospital
 They want on-demand, practical support
 And they want to have fun
 They want to go out, do interesting things with like-minded people, and make friends like we've all made friends at every stage of our lives
 So we rented a phone line, hired a couple of handymen, and started a service we called "Circle
" And Circle offers its local membership a toll-free 0 800 number that they can call on demand for any support
 And people have called us for so many reasons
 They've called because their pets are unwell, their DVD is broken, they've forgotten how to use their mobile phone, or maybe they are coming out of hospital and they want someone to be there
 And Circle also offers a rich social calendar -- knitting, darts, museum tours, hot air ballooning -- you name it
 But here's the interesting thing, the really deep change: over time, the friendships that have formed have begun to replace the practical offer
So let me tell you about Belinda
 Belinda's a Circle member, and she was going into hospital for a hip operation, so she called her local Circle to say they wouldn't see her for a bit
 And Damon, who runs the local Circle, calls her back and says, "How can I help?" And Belinda says, "Oh no, I'm fine -- Jocelyn is doing the shopping, Tony's doing the gardening, Melissa and Joe are going to come in and cook and chat
" So five Circle members had organized themselves to take care of Belinda
 And Belinda's 80, although she says that she feels 25 inside, but she also says that she felt stuck and pretty down when she joined Circle
 But the simple act of encouraging her to come along to that first event led to a process where natural friendships formed, friendships that today are replacing the need for expensive services
So I think that three factors have converged that enable us to put relationships at the heart and center of how we solve social problems today
 Firstly, the nature of the problems -- they've changed, and they require different solutions
 Secondly, the cost, human as much as financial, of doing business as usual
 And thirdly, technology
 It's technology that enables these approaches to scale and potentially now support thousands of people
 So the technology we've used is really simple, it's made up of available things like databases, mobile phones
 Circle has got this very simple system that underpins it, enables a small local team to support a membership of up to a thousand
 And you can contrast this with a neighborhood organization of the 1970s, when this kind of scale just wasn't possible, neither was the quality or the longevity that the spine of technology can provide
So it's relationships underpinned by technology that can turn the Beveridge models on their heads
 The Beveridge models are all about institutions with finite resources, anonymously managing access
 In my work at the front line, I've seen again and again how up to 80 percent of resource is spent keeping people out
 So professionals have to administer these increasingly complex forms of administration that are basically about stopping people accessing the service or managing the queue
 And Circle, like the relational services that we and others have designed, inverts this logic
 What it says is, the more people, the more relationships, the stronger the solution
 So I want to tell you my third and final story, which is about unemployment
 In Britain, as in most places in the world, our welfare states were primarily designed to get people into work, to educate them for this, and to keep them healthy
But guess how most people find work today? Through word of mouth
 It turns out that in Britain today, most new jobs are not advertised
 So it's friends that tell you about a job, it's friends that recommend you for a job, and it's a rich and diverse social network that helps you find work
 But not surprisingly, people who perhaps most need this rich and diverse network are those who are most isolated from it
 We designed a service that encourages people to meet up, people in and out of work, to work together in structured ways and try new opportunities
 And, well, it's very hard to compare the results of these new systems with the old transactional models, but it looks like, with our first 1,000 members, we outperformed existing services by a factor of three, at a fraction of the cost
 And here, too, we've used technology, but not to network people in the way that a social platform would do
 We've used it to bring people face to face and connect them with each other, building real relationships and supporting people to find work
At the end of his life, in 1948, Beveridge wrote a third report
 And in it he said he had made a dreadful mistake
 He had left people and their communities out
 And this omission, he said, led to seeing people, and people starting to see themselves, within the categories of the bureaucracies and the institutions
 And human relationships were already withering
 But unfortunately, this third report was much less read than Beveridge's earlier work
But today, we need to bring people and their communities back into the heart of the way we design new systems and new services, in an approach that I call "Relational Welfare
" We need to leave behind these old, transactional, unsuitable, outdated models, and we need to adopt instead the shared collective relational responses that can support a family like Ella's, that can address an issue like loneliness, that can support people into work and up the skills curve in a modern labor market, that can also address challenges of education, of health care systems, and so many more of those problems that are pressing on our societies
 It is all about relationships
 Relationships are the critical resource we have
 It is the continent hidden under the surface of the earth
 It is largely unexplored, poorly understood, and the stuff of legends
 But it is made also of dramatic landscapes like this huge underground chamber, and it is rich with surprising biological and mineralogical worlds
Thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers in the last three centuries -- actually, we know also thanks to satellite technology, of course -- we know almost every single square meter of our planet's surface
 Because a cave landscape, like this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden, the potential of cave exploration -- the geographical dimension -- is poorly understood and unappreciated
 Because we are creatures living on the surface, our perception of the inner side of the planet is in some ways skewed, as is that of the depth of the oceans or of the upper atmosphere
 A single cave system, like Mammoth Cave, which is in Kentucky, can be as long as more than 600 kilometers
 And an abyss like Krubera Voronya, which is in the Caucasus region, actually the deepest cave explored in the world, can go as far as more than 2,000 meters below the surface
 That means a journey of weeks for a cave explorer
 So karstic regions are areas of the world where the infiltrating water along cracks, fractures, can easily dissolve soluble lithologies, forming a drainage system of tunnels, conduits -- a three-dimensional network, actually
 Karstic regions cover almost 20 percent of the continents' surface, and we know actually that speleologists in the last 50 years have explored roughly 30,000 kilometers of cave passages around the world, which is a big number
 But geologists have estimated that what is still missing, to be discovered and mapped, is something around 10 million kilometers
That means that for each meter of a cave that we already know, that we have explored, there are still some tens of kilometers of undiscovered passages
 That means that this is really an endless continent, and we will never be able to explore it completely
 And this estimation is made without considering other types of caves, like, for example, inside glaciers or even volcanic caves, which are not karstic, but are formed by lava flows
 And if we have a look at other planets like, for example, Mars, you will see that this characteristic is not so specific of our home planet
I'm a speleologist, that means a cave explorer
 And I started with this passion when I was really young in the mountains not far from my hometown in North Italy, in the karstic regions of the Alps and the Dolomites
 And in 2009, I had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains, which are in the Orinoco and Amazon basins
 These massifs enchanted me from the first time I saw them
 They are surrounded by vertical, vertiginous rock walls with silvery waterfalls that are lost in the forest
 They really inspired in me a sense of wilderness, with a soul older than millions and millions of years
 And this dramatic landscape inspired among other things also Conan Doyle's "The Lost World" novel in 1912
 Scientists consider those mountains as islands in time, being separated from the surrounding lowlands since tens of millions of years ago
 And, in fact, only a few of these mountains have been climbed and explored on their top
 So we do not expect at all to find a cave there
 Despite this, in the last 10 years, speleologists from Italy, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and, of course, Venezuela and Brazil, have explored several caves in this area
 So how can it be possible?
To understand this contradiction, we have to consider the time factor, because the history of the tepuis is extremely long, starting about 1
6 billion years ago with the formation of the rock, and then evolving with the uplift of the region 150 million years ago, after the disruption of the Pangaea supercontinent and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean
 So you can imagine that the water had tens or even hundreds of millions of years to sculpt the strangest forms on the tepuis' surfaces, but also to open the fractures and form stone cities, rock cities, fields of towers which are characterized in the famous landscape of the tepuis
 But nobody could have imagined what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame
And so I was focusing in 2010 on one of those massifs, the Auyán-tepui, which is very famous because it hosts Angel Falls, which is the highest waterfall in the world -- about 979 meters of vertical drop
 And I was searching for hints of the existence of cave systems through satellite images, and finally we identified an area of collapses of the surface -- so, big boulders, rock piles -- and that means that there was a void below
 It was a clear indication that there was something inside the mountain
 There are strong winds, and there are almost 4,000 millimeters of rainfall per year, so it's really, really difficult to find good conditions
The cave is huge
 It's a huge network under the surface of the tepui plateau, and in only ten days of expedition, we explored more than 20 kilometers of cave passages
 And it's a huge network of underground rivers, channels, big rooms, extremely deep shafts
So it's really an incredible place
 And we named it Imawarì Yeuta
 That means, in the Pemón indigenous language, "The House of the Gods
" You have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there
 It was impossible for them to reach this area
And the caves represent, really, a snapshot of the past
 What you can find there is really evidence of a lost world
When you enter a quartzite cave, you have to completely forget what you know about caves -- classic limestone caves or the touristic caves that you can visit in several places in the world
 But you can find even stranger forms, like these mushrooms of silica growing on a boulder
 And you can imagine our talks when we were exploring the cave
 We were the first entering and discovering those unknown things, things like those monster eggs
 And we were a bit scared because it was all a discovery, and we didn't want to find a dinosaur
 We didn't find a dinosaur
 Stromatolites are some of the oldest forms of life that we can find on earth
 And here in the tepuis, the interesting thing is that these bacteria colonies have evolved in complete isolation from the external surface, and without being in contact with humans
 They have never been in contact with humans
 So the implications for science are enormous, because here you could find, for example, microbes that could be useful to resolve diseases in medicine, or you could find even a new kind of material with unknown properties
 And, in fact, we discovered in the cave a new mineral structure for science, which is rossiantonite, a phosphate-sulfate
So whatever you find in the cave, even a small cricket, has evolved in the dark in complete isolation
 What seems only a dark, empty environment could be in reality a chest of wonders full of useful information
With a team of Italian, Venezuelan and Brazilian speleologists, which is called La Venta Teraphosa, we will be back soon to Latin America, because we want to explore other tepuis in the farthest areas of the Amazon
 There are still very unknown mountains, like Marahuaca, which is almost 3,000 meters high above sea level, or Aracà, which is in the upper region of Rio Negro in Brazil
 And we suppose that we could find there even bigger cave systems, and each one with its own undiscovered world
Thank you
 Give me that to start so we don't forget
 Francesco, you said we don't need to go to Mars to find alien life, and indeed, last time we spoke, you were in Sardinia and you were training European astronauts
 So what do you, a speleologist, tell and teach to the astronauts?
 Yeah, we are -- it's a program of training for not only European, but also NASA, Roskosmos, JAXA astronauts, in a cave
 So they stay in a cave for about one week in isolation
 They have to work together in a real, real dangerous environment, and it's a real alien environment for them because it's unusual
 They have to do science
 They have a lot of tasks
 And it's very similar to a journey to Mars or the International Space Station
 In principle
 FS: Yes
 I want to go back to one of the pictures that was in your slide show, and it's just representative of the other photos --
Weren't those photos amazing? Yeah?
 I have to thank the photographers from the team La Venta, because all of those photos are from the photographers
 You bring, actually, photographers with you in the expedition
 They're professionals, they're speleologists and photographers
 But when I look at these pictures, I wonder: there is zero light down there, and yet they look incredibly well-exposed
 How do you take these pictures? How do your colleagues, the photographers, take these pictures?
 Yeah
 They are working in a darkroom, basically, so you can open the shutter of the camera and use the lights to paint the environment
 So you're basically --
 Yes
 The final result is what you want to achieve
 Maybe we can try this at home someday, I don't know
 Francesco, grazie
 FS: Grazie
I'd like to start by asking you all to go to your happy place, please
 Yes, your happy place, I know you've got one even if it's fake
OK, so, comfortable? Good
Now I'd like to you to mentally answer the following questions
 Is there any strip lighting in your happy place? Any plastic tables? Polyester flooring? Mobile phones? No? I think we all know that our happy place is meant to be somewhere natural, outdoors -- on a beach, fireside
 We'll be reading or eating or knitting
 And we're surrounded by natural light and organic elements
 Natural things make us happy
 And happiness is a great motivator; we strive for happiness
 Perhaps that's why we're always redesigning everything, in the hopes that our solutions might feel more natural
 So let's start there -- with the idea that good design should feel natural
Your phone is not very natural
 We're not addicted to devices, we're addicted to the information that flows through them
 I wonder how long you would be happy in your happy place without any information from the outside world
 I'm interested in how we access that information, how we experience it
 We're moving from a time of static information, held in books and libraries and bus stops, through a period of digital information, towards a period of fluid information, where your children will expect to be able to access anything, anywhere at any time, from quantum physics to medieval viticulture, from gender theory to tomorrow's weather, just like switching on a lightbulb -- Imagine that
Humans also like simple tools
 Your phone is not a very simple tool
 A fork is a simple tool
And we don't like them made of plastic, in the same way I don't really like my phone very much -- it's not how I want to experience information
I think there are better solutions than a world mediated by screens
 I don't hate screens, but I don't feel -- and I don't think any of us feel that good about how much time we spend slouched over them
 Fortunately, the big tech companies seem to agree
 And I think, actually, that's already really happening
 For me they are time machines -- atoms and molecules bound in space, from the moment of their creation to the moment of my experience
 But frankly, the content's identical on my phone
 We need screens, of course
 I'm going to show film, I need the enormous screen
 Your phone is not the Internet's door bitch
We can build things -- physical things, using physics and pixels, that can integrate the Internet into the world around us
 And I'm going to show you a few examples of those
A while ago, I got to work with a design agency, Berg, on an exploration of what the Internet without screens might actually look like
 And they showed us a range ways that light can work with simple senses and physical objects to really bring the Internet to life, to make it tangible
 Like this wonderfully mechanical YouTube player
 And this was an inspiration to me
 We wanted to create an object that could capture the subjective data around mood swings that's so essential to diagnosis
 And then you might revisit those moments later, and add context to them online
 Most of all, we wanted to create an intimate, beautiful thing that could live in your pocket and be loved
The binoculars are actually a birthday present for the Sydney Opera House's 40th anniversary
using Street View
 And then we stuck them under the steps
 Basically, it's virtual reality circa 1955
In our office we use hacky sacks to exchange URLs
 This is incredibly simple, it's like your Opal card
 You basically put a website on the little chip in here, and then you do this and 
 bosh! -- the website appears on your phone
 It's about 10 cents
Treehugger is a project that we're working on with Grumpy Sailor and Finch, here in Sydney
 And I'm very excited about what might happen when you pull the phones apart and you put the bits into trees, and that my children might have an opportunity to visit an enchanted forest guided by a magic wand, where they could talk to digital fairies and ask them questions, and be asked questions in return
 As you can see, we're at the cardboard stage with this one
But I'm very excited by the possibility of getting kids back outside without screens, but with all the powerful magic of the Internet at their fingertips
 And we hope to have something like this working by the end of the year
So let's recap
 Humans like natural solutions
 Humans love information
 Humans need simple tools
 These principles should underpin how we design for the future, not just for the Internet
 You may feel uncomfortable about the age of information that we're moving into
 You may feel challenged, rather than simply excited
 Guess what? Me too
 It's a really extraordinary period of human history
We are the people that actually build our world, there are no artificial intelligences
 yet
It's us -- designers, architects, artists, engineers
 And if we challenge ourselves, I think that actually we can have a happy place filled with the information we love that feels as natural and as simple as switching on lightbulb
 And although it may seem inevitable, that what the public wants is watches and websites and widgets, maybe we could give a bit of thought to cork and light and hacky sacks
Thank you very much
A few years ago, with my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier, I invented a new technology for editing genomes
 It's called CRISPR-Cas9
You might be interested to know that the CRISPR technology came about through a basic research project that was aimed at discovering how bacteria fight viral infections
 Bacteria have to deal with viruses in their environment, and we can think about a viral infection like a ticking time bomb -- a bacterium has only a few minutes to defuse the bomb before it gets destroyed
 So, many bacteria have in their cells an adaptive immune system called CRISPR, that allows them to detect viral DNA and destroy it
 Chinese scientists showed recently that they could even use the CRISPR technology to change genes in human embryos
 And scientists in Philadelphia showed they could use CRISPR to remove the DNA of an integrated HIV virus from infected human cells
The opportunity to do this kind of genome editing also raises various ethical issues that we have to consider, because this technology can be employed not only in adult cells, but also in the embryos of organisms, including our own species
 And so, together with my colleagues, I've called for a global conversation about the technology that I co-invented, so that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications of a technology like this
What I want to do now is tell you what the CRISPR technology is, what it can do, where we are today and why I think we need to take a prudent path forward in the way that we employ this technology
 And in a bacterium, the CRISPR system allows that DNA to be plucked out of the virus, and inserted in little bits into the chromosome -- the DNA of the bacterium
 And these integrated bits of viral DNA get inserted at a site called CRISPR
 
A big mouthful -- you can see why we use the acronym CRISPR
 It's a mechanism that allows cells to record, over time, the viruses they have been exposed to
 This allows the cells to keep a record of infection, and as my colleague, Blake Wiedenheft, likes to say, the CRISPR locus is effectively a genetic vaccination card in cells
 Once those bits of DNA have been inserted into the bacterial chromosome, the cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called RNA, which is orange in this picture, that is an exact replicate of the viral DNA
 RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA, and it allows interaction with DNA molecules that have a matching sequence
 It searches through all of the DNA in the cell, to find sites that match the sequences in the bound RNAs
 And when those sites are found -- as you can see here, the blue molecule is DNA -- this complex associates with that DNA and allows the Cas9 cleaver to cut up the viral DNA
 So we can think of the Cas9 RNA sentinel complex like a pair of scissors that can cut DNA -- it makes a double-stranded break in the DNA helix
 And importantly, this complex is programmable, so it can be programmed to recognize particular DNA sequences, and make a break in the DNA at that site
As I'm going to tell you now, we recognized that that activity could be harnessed for genome engineering, to allow cells to make a very precise change to the DNA at the site where this break was introduced
 That's sort of analogous to the way that we use a word-processing program to fix a typo in a document
The reason we envisioned using the CRISPR system for genome engineering is because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA and repair it
 So when a plant or an animal cell detects a double-stranded break in its DNA, it can fix that break, either by pasting together the ends of the broken DNA with a little, tiny change in the sequence of that position, or it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut
 So if we have a way to introduce double-stranded breaks into DNA at precise places, we can trigger cells to repair those breaks, by either the disruption or incorporation of new genetic information
 So if we were able to program the CRISPR technology to make a break in DNA at the position at or near a mutation causing cystic fibrosis, for example, we could trigger cells to repair that mutation
Genome engineering is actually not new, it's been in development since the 1970s
 We've had technologies for sequencing DNA, for copying DNA, and even for manipulating DNA
 And these technologies were very promising, but the problem was that they were either inefficient, or they were difficult enough to use that most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories, or certainly for many clinical applications
 So, the opportunity to take a technology like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal, because of its relative simplicity
 We can think of older genome engineering technologies as similar to having to rewire your computer each time you want to run a new piece of software, whereas the CRISPR technology is like software for the genome, we can program it easily, using these little bits of RNA
So once a double-stranded break is made in DNA, we can induce repair, and thereby potentially achieve astounding things, like being able to correct mutations that cause sickle cell anemia or cause Huntington's Disease
 I actually think that the first applications of the CRISPR technology are going to happen in the blood, where it's relatively easier to deliver this tool into cells, compared to solid tissues
Right now, a lot of the work that's going on applies to animal models of human disease, such as mice
 The technology is being used to make very precise changes that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell's DNA affect either a tissue or, in this case, an entire organism
Now in this example, the CRISPR technology was used to disrupt a gene by making a tiny change in the DNA in a gene that is responsible for the black coat color of these mice
 Imagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter-mates by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome, and they're otherwise completely normal
 And when we sequence the DNA from these animals, we find that the change in the DNA has occurred at exactly the place where we induced it, using the CRISPR technology
Additional experiments are going on in other animals that are useful for creating models for human disease, such as monkeys
 And here we find that we can use these systems to test the application of this technology in particular tissues, for example, figuring out how to deliver the CRISPR tool into cells
 We also want to understand better how to control the way that DNA is repaired after it's cut, and also to figure out how to control and limit any kind of off-target, or unintended effects of using the technology
I think that we will see clinical application of this technology, certainly in adults, within the next 10 years
 I think that it's likely that we will see clinical trials and possibly even approved therapies within that time, which is a very exciting thing to think about
 And because of the excitement around this technology, there's a lot of interest in start-up companies that have been founded to commercialize the CRISPR technology, and lots of venture capitalists that have been investing in these companies
But we have to also consider that the CRISPR technology can be used for things like enhancement
 "Designer humans," if you will
 Right now, the genetic information to understand what types of genes would give rise to these traits is mostly not known
 But it's important to know that the CRISPR technology gives us a tool to make such changes, once that knowledge becomes available
This raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider, and this is why I and my colleagues have called for a global pause in any clinical application of the CRISPR technology in human embryos, to give us time to really consider all of the various implications of doing so
 And actually, there is an important precedent for such a pause from the 1970s, when scientists got together to call for a moratorium on the use of molecular cloning, until the safety of that technology could be tested carefully and validated
So, genome-engineered humans are not with us yet, but this is no longer science fiction
 And this puts in front of all of us a huge responsibility, to consider carefully both the unintended consequences as well as the intended impacts of a scientific breakthrough
Thank you
 Jennifer, this is a technology with huge consequences, as you pointed out
 There are, of course, the therapeutic results of this, but then there are the un-therapeutic ones and they seem to be the ones gaining traction, particularly in the media
 This is one of the latest issues of The Economist -- "Editing humanity
" It's all about genetic enhancement, it's not about therapeutics
 What kind of reactions did you get back in March from your colleagues in the science world, when you asked or suggested that we should actually pause this for a moment and think about it?
 My colleagues were actually, I think, delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this openly
 So clearly it's a topic that needs careful consideration and discussion
 There's a big meeting happening in December that you and your colleagues are calling, together with the National Academy of Sciences and others, what do you hope will come out of the meeting, practically?
 Well, I hope that we can air the views of many different individuals and stakeholders who want to think about how to use this technology responsibly
 It may not be possible to come up with a consensus point of view, but I think we should at least understand what all the issues are as we go forward
 Now, colleagues of yours, like George Church, for example, at Harvard, they say, "Yeah, ethical issues basically are just a question of safety
 We test and test and test again, in animals and in labs, and then once we feel it's safe enough, we move on to humans
 Is there a possible split happening in the science community about this? I mean, are we going to see some people holding back because they have ethical concerns, and some others just going forward because some countries under-regulate or don't regulate at all?
 I think that in the end, this technology will be used for human genome engineering, but I think to do that without careful consideration and discussion of the risks and potential complications would not be responsible
 There are a lot of technologies and other fields of science that are developing exponentially, pretty much like yours
 I'm thinking about artificial intelligence, autonomous robots and so on
 No one seems -- aside from autonomous warfare robots -- nobody seems to have launched a similar discussion in those fields, in calling for a moratorium
 Do you think that your discussion may serve as a blueprint for other fields?
 Well, I think it's hard for scientists to get out of the laboratory
 Speaking for myself, it's a little bit uncomfortable to do that
 But I do think that being involved in the genesis of this really puts me and my colleagues in a position of responsibility
 And I would say that I certainly hope that other technologies will be considered in the same way, just as we would want to consider something that could have implications in other fields besides biology
 Jennifer, thanks for coming to TED
 Thank you
Father Daniel Berrigan once said that "writing about prisoners is a little like writing about the dead
 They're unseen and unheard
As a journalist, I think these stories of what people in power do when no one is watching, are precisely the stories that we need to tell
 That's why I began investigating the most secretive and experimental prison units in the United States, for so-called "second-tier" terrorists
 The government calls these units Communications Management Units or CMUs
 Prisoners and guards call them "Little Guantanamo
" They are islands unto themselves
 One was opened inside the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, and the other is inside this prison, in Marion, Illinois
 CMU prisoners have all been convicted of crimes
 I'm not here to argue the guilt or innocence of any prisoner
 I'm here because as Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall said, "When the prisons and gates slam shut, prisoners do not lose their human quality
"
Every prisoner I've interviewed has said there are three flecks of light in the darkness of prison: phone calls, letters and visits from family
 CMUs aren't solitary confinement, but they radically restrict all of these to levels that meet or exceed the most extreme prisons in the United States
 Their phone calls can be limited to 45 minutes a month, compared to the 300 minutes other prisoners receive
 Their letters can be limited to six pieces of paper
 Their visits can be limited to four hours per month, compared to the 35 hours that people like Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph receive in the supermax
 On top of that, CMU visits are non-contact which means prisoners are not allowed to even hug their family
 As one CMU prisoner said, "We're not being tortured here, except psychologically
"
The government won't say who is imprisoned here
 But through court documents, open records requests and interviews with current and former prisoners, some small windows into the CMUs have opened
There's an estimated 60 to 70 prisoners here, and they're overwhelmingly Muslim
 They include people like Dr
 They've included people like Yassin Aref
 Aref and his family fled to New York from Saddam Hussein's Iraq as refugees
 He was arrested in 2004 as part of an FBI sting
 Aref is an imam and he was asked to bear witness to a loan, which is a tradition in Islamic culture
 It turned out that one of the people involved in the loan was trying to enlist someone else in a fake attack
 Aref didn't know
 For that, he was convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to a terrorist group
The CMUs also include some non-Muslim prisoners
 The guards call them "balancers," meaning they help balance out the racial numbers, in hopes of deflecting law suits
 These balancers include animal rights and environmental activists like Daniel McGowan
McGowan was convicted of participating in two arsons in the name of defending the environment as part of the Earth Liberation Front
 During his sentencing, he was afraid that he would be sent to a rumored secret prison for terrorists
 The judge dismissed all those fears, saying that they weren't supported by any facts
 But that might be because the government hasn't fully explained why some prisoners end up in a CMU, and who is responsible for these decisions
 When McGowan was transferred, he was told it's because he is a "domestic terrorist," a term the FBI uses repeatedly when talking about environmental activists
 Now, keep in mind there are about 400 prisoners in US prisons who are classified as terrorists, and only a handful of them are in the CMUs
 In McGowan's case, he was previously at a low-security prison and he had no communications violations
So, why was he moved? Like other CMU prisoners, McGowan repeatedly asked for an answer, a hearing, or some opportunity for an appeal
 This example from another prisoner shows how those requests are viewed
 "Wants a transfer
" At one point, the prison warden himself recommended McGowan's transfer out of the CMU citing his good behavior, but the warden was overruled by the Bureau of Prison's Counterterrorism Unit, working with the Joint Terrorism Task Force of the FBI
Later I found out that McGowan was really sent to a CMU not because of what he did, but what he has said
 A memo from the Counterterrorism Unit cited McGowan's "anti-government beliefs
" While imprisoned, he continued writing about environmental issues, saying that activists must reflect on their mistakes and listen to each other
 Now, in fairness, if you've spent any time at all in Washington, DC, you know this is really a radical concept for the government
I actually asked to visit McGowan in the CMU
 And I was approved
 That came as quite a shock
 First, because as I've discussed on this stage before, I learned that the FBI has been monitoring my work
 Second, because it would make me the first and only journalist to visit a CMU
I was allowed to visit McGowan as a friend, not a journalist
 Journalists are not allowed here
 McGowan was told by CMU officials that if I asked any questions or published any story, that he would be punished for my reporting
 When I arrived for our visit, the guards reminded me that they knew who I was and knew about my work
 And they said that if I attempted to interview McGowan, the visit would be terminated
" But I think that's an Orwellian way of describing black holes
 When you visit a CMU, you go through all the security checkpoints that you would expect
 But then the walk to the visitation room is silent
 When a CMU prisoner has a visit, the rest of the prison is on lockdown
 I was ushered into a small room, so small my outstretched arms could touch each wall
 The unit insists that all the visits have to be in English for CMU prisoners, which is an additional hardship for many of the Muslim families
 There is a thick sheet of foggy, bulletproof glass and on the other side was Daniel McGowan
 We spoke through these handsets attached to the wall and talked about books and movies
 To fight boredom and amuse himself while in the CMU, McGowan had been spreading a rumor that I was secretly the president of a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC
During our visit, McGowan spoke most and at length about his niece Lily, his wife Jenny and how torturous it feels to never be able to hug them, to never be able to hold their hands
 He wanted to see what the government was saying about him, and for that he was sent back to the CMU
 When he was finally released at the end of his sentence, his story got even more Kafkaesque
The next day he was thrown back in jail for his political speech
 His attorneys quickly secured his release, but the message was very clear: Don't talk about this place
Today, nine years after they were opened by the Bush administration, the government is codifying how and why CMUs were created
 According to the Bureau of Prisons, they are for prisoners with "inspirational significance
" I think that is very nice way of saying these are political prisons for political prisoners
Prisoners are sent to a CMU because of their race, their religion or their political beliefs
Now, if you think that characterization is too strong, just look at some of the government's own documents
 When some of McGowan's mail was rejected by the CMU, the sender was told it's because the letters were intended "for political prisoners
" When another prisoner, animal rights activist Andy Stepanian, was sent to a CMU, it was because of his anti-government and anti-corporate views
 But the unknown reality is that the US has a dark history of disproportionately punishing people because of their political beliefs
 In the 1960s, before Marion was home to the CMU, it was home to the notorious Control Unit
 Prisoners were locked down in solitary for 22 hours a day
 The warden said the unit was to "control revolutionary attitudes
" In the 1980s, another experiment called the Lexington High Security Unit held women connected to the Weather Underground, Black Liberation and Puerto Rican independent struggles
 The prison radically restricted communication and used sleep deprivation, and constant light for so-called "ideological conversion
" Those prisons were eventually shut down, but only through the campaigning of religious groups and human rights advocates, like Amnesty International
Today, civil rights lawyers with the Center for Constitutional Rights are challenging CMUs in court for depriving prisoners of their due process rights and for retaliating against them for their protected political and religious speech
 Many of these documents would have never come to light without this lawsuit
The message of these groups and my message for you today is that we must bear witness to what is being done to these prisoners
 This story is not just about prisoners
 It is about our own commitment to human rights
 It is about whether we will choose to stop repeating the mistakes of our past
 If we don't listen to what Father Berrigan described as the stories of the dead, they will soon become the stories of ourselves
Thank you
 I have a couple questions
 How could this possibly be happening?
 I think that's the number one question I get throughout all of my work, and the short answer is that people don't know
 They're dependent on knowledge that it's actually happening and then a means and efficacy to actually make a change
 Isn't it guaranteed in prison that you have right to council or access to council?
 There's a tendency in our culture to see when people have been convicted of a crime, no matter if that charge was bogus or legitimate, that whatever happens to them after that is warranted
 And I think that's a really damaging and dangerous narrative that we have, that allows these types of things to happen, as the general public just kind of turns a blind eye to it
 All those documents on screen were all real documents, word for word, unchanged at all, right?
 Absolutely
 I've actually uploaded all of them to my website
 It's willpotter
com/CMU and it's a footnoted version of the talk, so you can see the documents for yourself without the little snippets
 You can see the full version
 I relied overwhelmingly on primary source documents or on primary interviews with former and current prisoners, with people that are dealing with this situation every day
 And like I said, I've been there myself, as well
 You're doing courageous work
 Thank you very much
 Thank you all
As a singer-songwriter, people often ask me about my influences or, as I like to call them, my sonic lineages
 But beyond genre, there is another question: how do the sounds we hear every day influence the music that we make? I believe that everyday soundscape can be the most unexpected inspiration for songwriting, and to look at this idea a little bit more closely, I'm going to talk today about three things: nature, language and silence -- or rather, the impossibility of true silence
 And through this I hope to give you a sense of a world already alive with musical expression, with each of us serving as active participants, whether we know it or not
 Here it is
It's beautiful, isn't it? Gotcha! That is actually not the sound of an opera singer warming up
 It was released as part of Peter Szöke's 1987 Hungarian recording "The Unknown Music of Birds," where he records many birds and slows down their pitches to reveal what's underneath
 Let's listen to the full-speed recording
Now, let's hear the two of them together so your brain can juxtapose them
It's incredible
 Perhaps the techniques of opera singing were inspired by birdsong
 As humans, we intuitively understand birds to be our musical teachers
In Ethiopia, birds are considered an integral part of the origin of music itself
 The story goes like this: 1,500 years ago, a young man was born in the Empire of Aksum, a major trading center of the ancient world
 His name was Yared
 When Yared was seven years old his father died, and his mother sent him to go live with an uncle, who was a priest of the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition, one of the oldest churches in the world
 Now, this tradition has an enormous amount of scholarship and learning, and Yared had to study and study and study and study, and one day he was studying under a tree, when three birds came to him
 They taught him music -- scales, in fact
 And Yared, eventually recognized as Saint Yared, used these scales to compose five volumes of chants and hymns for worship and celebration
 And he used these scales to compose and to create an indigenous musical notation system
 And these scales evolved into what is known as kiñit, the unique, pentatonic, five-note, modal system that is very much alive and thriving and still evolving in Ethiopia today
Now, I love this story because it's true at multiple levels
 Saint Yared was a real, historical figure, and the natural world can be our musical teacher
 And countless works of music were inspired by bird and forest song
 Yes, the natural world can be our cultural teacher
 Every language communicates with pitch to varying degrees, whether it's Mandarin Chinese, where a shift in melodic inflection gives the same phonetic syllable an entirely different meaning, to a language like English, where a raised pitch at the end of a sentence 
  implies a question?
As an Ethiopian-American woman, I grew up around the language of Amharic, Amhariña
 It was my first language, the language of my parents, one of the main languages of Ethiopia
 And there are a million reasons to fall in love with this language: its depth of poetics, its double entendres, its wax and gold, its humor, its proverbs that illuminate the wisdom and follies of life
 But there's also this melodicism, a musicality built right in
 Take, for example, the word: "indey
" Now, if there are Ethiopians in the audience, they're probably chuckling to themselves, because the word means something like "No!" or "How could he?" or "No, he didn't
" It kind of depends on the situation
 It has a melody
 You can almost see the shape as it springs from someone's mouth
 "Indey" -- it dips, and then raises again
 And as a musician and composer, when I hear that word, something like this is floating through my mind
 Lickih nehu
" It's an affirmation, an agreement
 "Lickih nehu
" When I hear that phrase, something like this starts rolling through my mind
And in both of those cases, what I did was I took the melody and the phrasing of those words and phrases and I turned them into musical parts to use in these short compositions
Now, this is based on the work of Jason Moran and others who work intimately with music and language, but it's also something I've had in my head since I was a kid, how musical my parents sounded when they were speaking to each other and to us
 Perhaps you can hear it in the words I'm speaking even now
Finally, we go to the 1950s United States and the most seminal work of 20th century avant-garde composition: John Cage's "4:33," written for any instrument or combination of instruments
 And this score has not a single note written and there is not a single note played for four minutes and 33 seconds
 And, at once enraging and enrapturing, Cage shows us that even when there are no strings being plucked by fingers or hands hammering piano keys, still there is music, still there is music, still there is music
 And what is this music? It was that sneeze in the back
It is the everyday soundscape that arises from the audience themselves: their coughs, their sighs, their rustles, their whispers, their sneezes, the room, the wood of the floors and the walls expanding and contracting, creaking and groaning with the heat and the cold, the pipes clanking and contributing
 And controversial though it was, and even controversial though it remains, Cage's point is that there is no such thing as true silence
 Even in the most silent environments, we still hear and feel the sound of our own heartbeats
 We are already immersed
Now, I had my own moment of, let's say, remixing John Cage a couple of months ago when I was standing in front of the stove cooking lentils
 And it was late one night and it was time to stir, so I lifted the lid off the cooking pot, and I placed it onto the kitchen counter next to me, and it started to roll back and forth making this sound
And it stopped me cold
" So when the lentils were ready and eaten, I hightailed it to my backyard studio, and I made this
Now, John Cage wasn't instructing musicians to mine the soundscape for sonic textures to turn into music
Musician, music researcher, surgeon and human hearing expert Charles Limb is a professor at Johns Hopkins University and he studies music and the brain
 And if that's true, it means that we're hard-wired for music, that we can find it anywhere, that there is no such thing as a musical desert, that we are permanently hanging out at the oasis, and that is marvelous
 We can add to the soundtrack, but it's already playing
And it doesn't mean don't study music
 Study music, trace your sonic lineages and enjoy that exploration
 When seeking melodic inspiration, look no further than dawn and dusk avian orchestras or to the natural lilt of emphatic language
 We make, we make, we make, we make, knowing that when it comes to nature or language or soundscape, there is no end to the inspiration -- if we are listening
Thank you
So this right here is the tiny village of Elle, close to Lista
 It's right at the southernmost tip of Norway
 And on January 2 this year, an elderly guy who lives in the village, he went out to see what was cast ashore during a recent storm
 And on a patch of grass right next to the water's edge, he found a wetsuit
 It was grey and black, and he thought it looked cheap
 Out of each leg of the wetsuit there were sticking two white bones
 It was clearly the remains of a human being
And usually, in Norway, dead people are identified quickly
 So the police started searching through missing reports from the local area, national missing reports, and looked for accidents with a possible connection
 They found nothing
 So they ran a DNA profile, and they started searching internationally through Interpol
 This was a person that nobody seemed to be missing
 It was an invisible life heading for a nameless grave
 But then, after a month, the police in Norway got a message from the police in the Netherlands
 But the police in the Netherlands managed to trace the wetsuit by an RFID chip that was sewn in the suit
 But this was all they were able to figure out
 The customer paid cash
 There was no surveillance footage from the shop
 So it became a cold case
 It's the spot in continental Europe closest to Britain, and a lot of migrants and refugees are staying in this camp and are trying desperately to cross over to Britain
 And right there was a plausible theory about the identity of the two people, and the police made this theory as well
 Because if you or I or anybody else with a firm connection to Europe goes missing off the coast of France, people would just know
 Your friends or family would report you missing, the police would come search for you, the media would know, and there would be pictures of you on lampposts
 It's difficult to disappear without a trace
 Well, if you disappear one day, nobody will notice
 The police won't come search for you because nobody knows you're gone
And this is what happened to Shadi Omar Kataf and Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria
Me and Tomm went to Calais for the first time in April this year, and after three months of investigation, we were able to tell the story about how these two young men fled the war in Syria, ended up stuck in Calais, bought wetsuits and drowned in what seems to have been an attempt to swim across the English Channel in order to reach England
 But it is also a story about what it's like to be a refugee in Europe today
 This is in Calais
 Right now, between 3,500 and 5,000 people are living here under horrible conditions
 It has been dubbed the worst refugee camp in Europe
 Limited access to food, limited access to water, limited access to health care
 Disease and infections are widespread
 And they're all stuck here because they're trying to get to England in order to claim asylum
 And they do that by hiding in the back of trucks headed for the ferry, or the Eurotunnel, or they sneak inside the tunnel terminal at night to try to hide on the trains
Most want to go to Britain because they know the language, and so they figure it would be easier to restart their lives from there
 They want to work, they want to study, they want to be able to continue their lives
 A lot of these people are highly educated and skilled workers
 If you go to Calais and talk to refugees, you'll meet lawyers, politicians, engineers, graphic designers, farmers, soldiers
 You've got the whole spectrum
 But who all of these people are usually gets lost in the way we talk about refugees and migrants, because we usually do that in statistics
So you have 60 million refugees globally
 About half a million have made the crossing over the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year, and roughly 4,000 are staying in Calais
 But these are numbers, and the numbers don't say anything about who these people are, where they came from, or why they're here
And first, I want to tell you about one of them
 This is 22-year-old Mouaz Al Balkhi from Syria
 We first heard about him after being in Calais the first time looking for answers to the theory of the two dead bodies
 So we flew over there and we met the uncle and we did DNA samples of him, and later on got additional DNA samples from Mouaz's closest relative who now lives in Jordan
 The analysis concluded the body who was found in a wetsuit on a beach in the Netherlands was actually Mouaz Al Balkhi
 And while we were doing all this investigation, we got to know Mouaz's story
 He was born in the Syrian capital of Damascus in 1991
 He was raised in a middle class family, and his father in the middle there is a chemical engineer who spent 11 years in prison for belonging to the political opposition in Syria
 While his father was in prison, Mouaz took responsibility and he cared for his three sisters
 They said he was that kind of guy
 Mouaz studied to become an electrical engineer at the University of Damascus
So a couple of years into the Syrian war, the family fled Damascus and went to the neighboring country, Jordan
 Their father had problems finding work in Jordan, and Mouaz could not continue his studies, so he figured, "OK, the best thing I can do to help my family would be to go somewhere where I can finish my studies and find work
" So he goes to Turkey
 So then he decides to head for the UK, where his uncle lives
 He makes it into Algeria, walks into Libya, pays a people smuggler to help him with the crossing into Italy by boat, and from there on he heads to Dunkirk, the city right next to Calais by the English Channel
 We know he made at least 12 failed attempts to cross the English Channel by hiding in a truck
 But at some point, he must have given up all hope
 The last night we know he was alive, he spent at a cheap hotel close to the train station in Dunkirk
 We found his name in the records, and he seems to have stayed there alone
 The day after, he went into Calais, entered a sports shop a couple of minutes before 8 o'clock in the evening, along with Shadi Kataf
 They both bought wetsuits, and the woman in the shop was the last person we know of to have seen them alive
 We have tried to figure out where Shadi met Mouaz, but we weren't able to do that
 But they do have a similar story
 We first heard about Shadi after a cousin of his, living in Germany, had read an Arabic translation of the story made of Mouaz on Facebook
 So we got in touch with him
 Shadi, a couple of years older than Mouaz, was also raised in Damascus
 He ran a tire repair shop and later worked in a printing company
 He lived with his extended family, but their house got bombed early in the war
 So the family fled to an area of Damascus known as Camp Yarmouk
Yarmouk is being described as the worst place to live on planet Earth
 There was a UN official who visited last year, and he said, "They ate all the grass so there was no grass left
" Out of a population of 150,000, only 18,000 are believed to still be left in Yarmouk
 Shadi and his sisters got out
 The parents are still stuck inside
 This was after the fall of Gaddafi, but before Libya turned into full-blown civil war
 And in this last remaining sort of stability in Libya, Shadi took up scuba diving, and he seemed to spend most of his time underwater
 Reality was not that easy
 We don't know much about his travels because he had a hard time communicating with his family, but we do know that he struggled
 And by the end of September, he was living on the streets somewhere in France
 On October 7, he calls his cousin in Belgium, and explains his situation
 He said, "I'm in Calais
 I need you to come get my backpack and my laptop
 I can't afford to pay the people smugglers to help me with the crossing to Britain, but I will go buy a wetsuit and I will swim
 What was left of Shadi was found nearly three months later, 800 kilometers away in a wetsuit on a beach in Norway
 He's still waiting for his funeral in Norway, and none of his family will be able to attend
Many may think that the story about Shadi and Mouaz is a story about death, but I don't agree
 To me, this is a story about two questions that I think we all share: what is a better life, and what am I willing to do to achieve it? And to me, and probably a lot of you, a better life would mean being able to do more of what we think of as meaningful, whether that be spending more time with your family and friends, travel to an exotic place, or just getting money to buy that cool new device or a pair of new sneakers
 And this is all within our reach pretty easily
But if you are fleeing a war zone, the answers to those two questions are dramatically different
 A better life is a life in safety
 It's a life in dignity
 A better life means not having your house bombed, not fearing being kidnapped
 It means being able to send your children to school, go to university, or just find work to be able to provide for yourself and the ones you love
 A better life would be a future of some possibilities compared to nearly none, and that's a strong motivation
 And I have no trouble imagining that after spending weeks or even months as a second-grade citizen, living on the streets or in a horrible makeshift camp with a stupid, racist name like "The Jungle," most of us would be willing to do just about anything
 If I could ask Shadi and Mouaz the second they stepped into the freezing waters of the English Channel, they would probably say, "This is worth the risk," because they could no longer see any other option
 And that's desperation, but that's the reality of living as a refugee in Western Europe in 2015
Thank you
 Thank you, Anders
 Tomm, you two have been back to Calais recently
 This was the third trip
 What has changed? What have you seen there?
 The first time we were in Calais, it was about 1,500 refugees there
 The last time, the camp has grown, maybe four or five thousand people
 It seemed more permanent, NGOs have arrived, a small school has opened
 But the thing is that the refugees have stayed for a longer time, and the French government has managed to seal off the borders better, so now The Jungle is growing, along with the despair and hopelessness among the refugees
 Are you planning to go back? And continue the reporting?
 Anders, I'm a former journalist, and to me, it's amazing that in the current climate of slashing budgets and publishers in crisis, Dagbladet has consented so many resources for this story, which tells a lot about newspapers taking the responsibility, but how did you sell it to your editors?
 It wasn't easy at first, because we weren't able to know what we actually could figure out
 As soon as it became clear that we actually could be able to identify who the first one was, we basically got the message that we could do whatever we wanted, just travel wherever you need to go, do whatever you need to do, just get this done
 The story, by the way, has been translated and published across several European countries, and certainly will continue to do
 And we want to read the updates from you
 Thank you Anders
 Thank you Tomm
We all go to doctors
 What if I told you that the medical science discovered over the past century has been based on only half the population?
I'm an emergency medicine doctor
 I was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency
 It's about saving lives
 How cool is that? OK, there's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes, but no matter who walks through the door to the ER, we order the same tests, we prescribe the same medication, without ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients
 Why would we? We were never taught that there were any differences between men and women
A recent Government Accountability study revealed that 80 percent of the drugs withdrawn from the market are due to side effects on women
 So let's think about that for a minute
 Why are we discovering side effects on women only after a drug has been released to the market? Do you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea to being tested on cells in a laboratory, to animal studies, to then clinical trials on humans, finally to go through a regulatory approval process, to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you? Not to mention the millions and billions of dollars of funding it takes to go through that process
 So why are we discovering unacceptable side effects on half the population after that has gone through? What's happening?
Well, it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory, they're male cells, and the animals used in the animal studies were male animals, and the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men
How is it that the male model became our framework for medical research? Let's look at an example that has been popularized in the media, and it has to do with the sleep aid Ambien
 Ambien was released on the market over 20 years ago, and since then, hundreds of millions of prescriptions have been written, primarily to women, because women suffer more sleep disorders than men
 But just this past year, the Food and Drug Administration recommended cutting the dose in half for women only, because they just realized that women metabolize the drug at a slower rate than men, causing them to wake up in the morning with more of the active drug in their system
 And then they're drowsy and they're getting behind the wheel of the car, and they're at risk for motor vehicle accidents
 And I can't help but think, as an emergency physician, how many of my patients that I've cared for over the years were involved in a motor vehicle accident that possibly could have been prevented if this type of analysis was performed and acted upon 20 years ago when this drug was first released
World War II changed a lot of things, and one of them was this need to protect people from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent
 So some much-needed guidelines or rules were set into place, and part of that was this desire to protect women of childbearing age from entering into any medical research studies
 There was fear: what if something happened to the fetus during the study? Who would be responsible? And so the scientists at this time actually thought this was a blessing in disguise, because let's face it -- men's bodies are pretty homogeneous
 They don't have the constantly fluctuating levels of hormones that could disrupt clean data they could get if they had only men
 It was easier
 Not to mention, at this time, there was a general assumption that men and women were alike in every way, apart from their reproductive organs and sex hormones
 So it was decided: medical research was performed on men, and the results were later applied to women
What did this do to the notion of women's health? Women's health became synonymous with reproduction: breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy
 It's this term we now refer to as "bikini medicine
 And it's because of this that the medical specialty of pediatrics came to light
 And we now conduct research on children in order to improve their lives
 And I know the same thing can be said about women
 Women are not just men with boobs and tubes
 But they have their own anatomy and physiology that deserves to be studied with the same intensity
Let's take the cardiovascular system, for example
 Men will complain of crushing chest pain -- an elephant is sitting on their chest
 And we call this typical
 Women have chest pain, too
 But more women than men will complain of "just not feeling right," "can't seem to get enough air in," "just so tired lately
" And for some reason we call this atypical, even though, as I mentioned, women do make up half the population
 And the test that we use to determine if someone is at risk for a heart attack, well, they were initially designed and tested and perfected in men, and so aren't as good at determining that in women
 And then if we think about the medications -- common medications that we use, like aspirin
 We give aspirin to healthy men to help prevent them from having a heart attack, but do you know that if you give aspirin to a healthy woman, it's actually harmful?
What this is doing is merely telling us that we are scratching the surface
 Emergency medicine is a fast-paced business
The Institute of Medicine has said every cell has a sex
 What does this mean? Sex is DNA
 And these two may not always match up, as we can see with our transgendered population
It used to be thought that those sex-determining chromosomes pictured here -- XY if you're male, XX if you're female -- merely determined whether you would be born with ovaries or testes, and it was the sex hormones that those organs produced that were responsible for the differences we see in the opposite sex
 But we now know that that theory was wrong -- or it's at least a little incomplete
 And thankfully, scientists like Dr
 This new knowledge is the game-changer, and it's up to those scientists that continue to find that evidence, but it's up to the clinicians to start translating this data at the bedside, today
 And to help do this, I'm a co-founder of a national organization called Sex and Gender Women's Health Collaborative, and we collect all of this data so that it's available for teaching and for patient care
 And we're working to bring together the medical educators to the table
 That's a big job
 It's changing the way medical training has been done since its inception
But I believe in them
 I know they're going to see the value of incorporating the gender lens into the current curriculum
 It's about training the future health care providers correctly
 And regionally, I'm a co-creator of a division within the Department of Emergency Medicine here at Brown University, called Sex and Gender in Emergency Medicine, and we conduct the research to determine the differences between men and women in emergent conditions, like heart disease and stroke and sepsis and substance abuse, but we also believe that education is paramount
We've created a 360-degree model of education
 Because this cannot just be left up to the health care leaders
 We all have a role in making a difference
 But I must warn you: this is not easy
 In fact, it's hard
 We now know just enough to know that we weren't doing it right
 has said, "Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle
"
And the first step towards change is awareness
 This is not just about improving medical care for women
 This is about personalized, individualized health care for everyone
 And from now on, I want you to ask your doctors whether the treatments you are receiving are specific to your sex and gender
 They may not know the answer -- yet
 But the conversation has begun, and together we can all learn
Thank you
In my lab, we build autonomous aerial robots like the one you see flying here
 Unlike the commercially available drones that you can buy today, this robot doesn't have any GPS on board
 So without GPS, it's hard for robots like this to determine their position
 This robot uses onboard sensors, cameras and laser scanners, to scan the environment
 And then it can assemble all these features into a map, like you see behind me
 And this map then allows the robot to understand where the obstacles are and navigate in a collision-free manner
What I want to show you next is a set of experiments we did inside our laboratory, where this robot was able to go for longer distances
 So here you'll see, on the top right, what the robot sees with the camera
 And on the main screen -- and of course this is sped up by a factor of four -- on the main screen you'll see the map that it's building
 So this is a high-resolution map of the corridor around our laboratory
 And in a minute you'll see it enter our lab, which is recognizable by the clutter that you see
 The first problem is it's pretty big
 And these robots consume about 100 watts per pound
 And this makes for a very short mission life
 The second problem is that these robots have onboard sensors that end up being very expensive -- a laser scanner, a camera and the processors
So we asked ourselves a question: what consumer product can you buy in an electronics store that is inexpensive, that's lightweight, that has sensing onboard and computation? And we invented the flying phone
 That joystick is just there to make sure if the robot goes crazy, Giuseppe can kill it
In addition to building these small robots, we also experiment with aggressive behaviors, like you see here
 So this robot is now traveling at two to three meters per second, pitching and rolling aggressively as it changes direction
 The main point is we can have smaller robots that can go faster and then travel in these very unstructured environments
And in this next video, just like you see this bird, an eagle, gracefully coordinating its wings, its eyes and feet to grab prey out of the water, our robot can go fishing, too
So you can see this robot going at about three meters per second, which is faster than walking speed, coordinating its arms, its claws and its flight with split-second timing to achieve this maneuver
 So in order to accomplish this, it actually has to pitch and adjust the altitude and swing the payload through
 So if you look at honeybees, and this is a slowed down video, they're so small, the inertia is so lightweight --
that they don't care -- they bounce off my hand, for example
 This is a little robot that mimics the honeybee behavior
 And smaller is better, because along with the small size you get lower inertia
 Along with lower inertia --
along with lower inertia, you're resistant to collisions
 And that makes you more robust
 So just like these honeybees, we build small robots
 And this particular one is only 25 grams in weight
 It consumes only six watts of power
 So if I normalize that to its size, it's like a Boeing 787 traveling ten times the speed of sound
And I want to show you an example
 This is probably the first planned mid-air collision, at one-twentieth normal speed
 The two-gram carbon fiber cage around it prevents the propellers from entangling, but essentially the collision is absorbed and the robot responds to the collisions
 And so small also means safe
 And if you plot a histogram of the number of Band-Aids we've ordered in the past, that sort of tailed off now
 Because these robots are really safe
The small size has some disadvantages, and nature has found a number of ways to compensate for these disadvantages
 The basic idea is they aggregate to form large groups, or swarms
 So, similarly, in our lab, we try to create artificial robot swarms
 And this is quite challenging because now you have to think about networks of robots
 And within each robot, you have to think about the interplay of sensing, communication, computation -- and this network then becomes quite difficult to control and manage
 The first idea is that robots need to be aware of their neighbors
 They need to be able to sense and communicate with their neighbors
So this video illustrates the basic idea
 You have four robots -- one of the robots has actually been hijacked by a human operator, literally
 But because the robots interact with each other, they sense their neighbors, they essentially follow
 And here there's a single person able to lead this network of followers
 So again, it's not because all the robots know where they're supposed to go
 It's because they're just reacting to the positions of their neighbors
So the next experiment illustrates the second organizing principle
 And this principle has to do with the principle of anonymity
 Here the key idea is that the robots are agnostic to the identities of their neighbors
 They're asked to form a circular shape, and no matter how many robots you introduce into the formation, or how many robots you pull out, each robot is simply reacting to its neighbor
 Now if you put these ideas together, the third idea is that we essentially give these robots mathematical descriptions of the shape they need to execute
 And they do this with the same kind of split-second coordination that you see in natural swarms, in nature
 The first one has to do with agriculture, which is probably the biggest problem that we're facing worldwide
 As you well know, one in every seven persons in this earth is malnourished
 Most of the land that we can cultivate has already been cultivated
 And the efficiency of most systems in the world is improving, but our production system efficiency is actually declining
So what can robots do? Well, we adopt an approach that's called Precision Farming in the community
 And the basic idea is that we fly aerial robots through orchards, and then we build precision models of individual plants
 So just like personalized medicine, while you might imagine wanting to treat every patient individually, what we'd like to do is build models of individual plants and then tell the farmer what kind of inputs every plant needs -- the inputs in this case being water, fertilizer and pesticide
 Here you'll see robots traveling through an apple orchard, and in a minute you'll see two of its companions doing the same thing on the left side
 And what they're doing is essentially building a map of the orchard
 Within the map is a map of every plant in this orchard
Let's see what those maps look like
 In the next video, you'll see the cameras that are being used on this robot
 On the top-left is essentially a standard color camera
 And on the bottom-left is a thermal camera
 Armed with information like this, we can do several things
 By doing this, you tell the farmer how many fruits she has in every tree and allow her to estimate the yield in the orchard, optimizing the production chain downstream
The second thing we can do is take models of plants, construct three-dimensional reconstructions, and from that estimate the canopy size, and then correlate the canopy size to the amount of leaf area on every plant
 And this is called the leaf area index
 So if you know this leaf area index, you essentially have a measure of how much photosynthesis is possible in every plant, which again tells you how healthy each plant is
 By combining visual and infrared information, we can also compute indices such as NDVI
 And in this particular case, you can essentially see there are some crops that are not doing as well as other crops
And then lastly, one thing we're interested in doing is detecting the early onset of chlorosis -- and this is an orange tree -- which is essentially seen by yellowing of leaves
Systems like this can really help, and we're projecting yields that can improve by about ten percent and, more importantly, decrease the amount of inputs such as water by 25 percent by using aerial robot swarms
Lastly, I want you to applaud the people who actually create the future, Yash Mulgaonkar, Sikang Liu and Giuseppe Loianno, who are responsible for the three demonstrations that you saw
Thank you
Do you think the world is going to be a better place next year? In the next decade? Can we end hunger, achieve gender equality, halt climate change, all in the next 15 years?
Well, according to the governments of the world, yes we can
Now that's the plan, but can we get there? Can this vision for a better world really be achieved? Well, I'm here today because we've run the numbers, and the answer, shockingly, is that maybe we actually can
 But not with business as usual
Now, the idea that the world is going to get a better place may seem a little fanciful
 Watch the news every day and the world seems to be going backwards, not forwards
 And let's be frank: it's pretty easy to be skeptical about grand announcements coming out of the UN
But please, I invite you to suspend your disbelief for just a moment
 Because back in 2001, the UN agreed another set of goals, the Millennium Development Goals
 And the flagship target there was to halve the proportion of people living in poverty by 2015
 The target was to take from a baseline of 1990, when 36 percent of the world's population lived in poverty, to get to 18 percent poverty this year
 We exceeded it
 Now, that's still not good enough, and the world does still have plenty of problems
 But the pessimists and doomsayers who say that the world can't get better are simply wrong
So how did we achieve this success? Well, a lot of it was because of economic growth
 Some of the biggest reductions in poverty were in countries such as China and India, which have seen rapid economic growth in recent years
 So can we pull off the same trick again? Can economic growth get us to the Global Goals? Well, to answer that question, we need to benchmark where the world is today against the Global Goals and figure out how far we have to travel
So to help us with this benchmarking, I'm going to use a tool called the Social Progress Index
 First of all, does everyone have the basic needs of survival: food, water, shelter, safety? Secondly, does everyone have the building blocks of a better life: education, information, health and a sustainable environment? And does everyone have the opportunity to improve their lives, through rights, freedom of choice, freedom from discrimination, and access to the world's most advanced knowledge?
The Social Progress Index sums all this together using 52 indicators to create an aggregate score on a scale of 0 to 100
 And what we find is that there's a wide diversity of performance in the world today
 The highest performing country, Norway, scores 88
 The lowest performing country, Central African Republic, scores 31
 And we can add up all the countries together, weighting for the different population sizes, and that global score is 61
That's where we are today: 61 out of 100
 What do we have to get to to achieve the Global Goals?
Now, the Global Goals are certainly ambitious, but they're not about turning the world into Norway in just 15 years
 So having looked at the numbers, my estimate is that a score of 75 would not only be a giant leap forward in human well-being, it would also count as hitting the Global Goals target
 Can we get there?
Well, the Social Progress Index can help us calculate this, because as you might have noticed, there are no economic indicators in there; there's no GDP or economic growth in the Social Progress Index model
Let me show you on this chart
 So here on the vertical axis, I've put social progress, the stuff the Global Goals are trying to achieve
 And then on the horizontal axis, is GDP per capita
 Further to the right means richer
 And in there, I'm now going to put all the countries of the world, each one represented by a dot, and on top of that I'm going to put the regression line that shows the average relationship
 However, as we get richer, each extra dollar of GDP is buying us less and less social progress
 So here is the world in 2015
 We have a social progress score of 61 and a GDP per capita of $14,000
 And the place we're trying to get to, remember, is 75, that Global Goals target
 Well, the best forecast we can find comes from the US Department of Agriculture, which forecasts 3
1 percent average global economic growth over the next 15 years, which means that in 2030, if they're right, per capita GDP will be about $23,000
 So now the question is: if we get that much richer, how much social progress are we going to get? Well, we asked a team of economists at Deloitte who checked and crunched the numbers, and they came back and said, well, look: if the world's average wealth goes from $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year, social progress is going to increase from 61 to 62
Just 62
4
 Just a tiny increase
Now this seems a bit strange
 Economic growth seems to have really helped in the fight against poverty, but it doesn't seem to be having much impact on trying to get to the Global Goals
 So what's going on? Well, I think there are two things
 The first is that in a way, we're the victims of our own success
 We've used up the easy wins from economic growth, and now we're moving on to harder problems
So that's the bad news
 We're not going to get to the Global Goals just by getting richer
So are the pessimists right?
Well, maybe not
 Because the Social Progress Index also has some very good news
 Let me take you back to that regression line
 So this is the average relationship between GDP and social progress, and this is what our last forecast was based on
 But as you saw already, there is actually lots of noise around this trend line
 We have countries that are underperforming on social progress, relative to their wealth
 Russia has lots of natural resource wealth, but lots of social problems
 China has boomed economically, but hasn't made much headway on human rights or environmental issues
 India has a space program and millions of people without toilets
 Now, on the other hand, we have countries that are overperforming on social progress relative to their GDP
 And Costa Rica's not alone
 From poor countries like Rwanda to richer countries like New Zealand, we see that it's possible to get lots of social progress, even if your GDP is not so great
And that's really important, because it tells us two things
 First of all, it tells us that we already in the world have the solutions to many of the problems that the Global Goals are trying to solve
 It also tells us that we're not slaves to GDP
 Our choices matter: if we prioritize the well-being of people, then we can make a lot more progress than our GDP might expect
How much? Enough to get us to the Global Goals? Well, let's look at some numbers
 What we know already: the world today is scoring 61 on social progress, and the place we want to get to is 75
 If we rely on economic growth alone, we're going to get to 62
4
 So let's assume now that we can get the countries that are currently underperforming on social progress -- the Russia, China, Indias -- just up to the average
 How much social progress does that get us? Well, that takes us to 65
 It's a bit better, but still quite a long way to go
 So let's get a little bit more optimistic and say, what if every country gets a little bit better at turning its wealth into well-being? Well then, we get to 67
 And now let's be even bolder still
Can we achieve the Global Goals? Certainly not with business as usual
 Even a flood tide of economic growth is not going to get us there, if it just raises the mega-yachts and the super-wealthy and leaves the rest behind
 If we're going to achieve the Global Goals we have to do things differently
 We have to prioritize social progress, and really scale solutions around the world
 I believe the Global Goals are a historic opportunity, because the world's leaders have promised to deliver them
 Let's not dismiss the goals or slide into pessimism; let's hold them to that promise
 And we need to hold them to that promise by holding them accountable, tracking their progress all the way through the next 15 years
And I want to finish by showing you a way to do that, called the People's Report Card
 The People's Report Card brings together all this data into a simple framework that we'll all be familiar with from our school days, to hold them to account
 Our world today is scoring a C-
 The Global Goals are all about getting to an A, and that's why we're going to be updating the People's Report Card annually, for the world and for all the countries of the world, so we can hold our leaders to account to achieve this target and fulfill this promise
 Because getting to the Global Goals will only happen if we do things differently, if our leaders do things differently, and for that to happen, that needs us to demand it
So let's reject business as usual
 Let's demand a different path
 Let's choose the world that we want
Thank you
 Thank you, Michael
 Michael, just one question: the Millennium Development Goals established 15 years ago, they were kind of applying to every country but it turned out to be really a scorecard for emerging countries
 How can I, as a private citizen, use the report card to create pressure for action?
 This is a really important point; it's a big shift in priorities -- it's no longer about poor countries and just poverty
 And every country is going to have challenges in getting to the Global Goals
 Even, I'm sorry to say, Bruno, Switzerland has got to work to do
 And so that's why we're going to produce these report cards in 2016 for every country in the world
 Then we can really see, how are we doing? And it's not going to be rich countries scoring straight A's
 And that, then, I think, is to provide a point of focus for people to start demanding action and start demanding progress
 Thank you very much
I was just thinking that I have been missing you way too long
There's something inside this weary head
that wants us to love just instead
But I was just thinking, merely thinking
I've got loads of pictures,
I've got the one of you in that dancing dress
But man I feel silly in that dim light
Just after doing you by the sight of my Kodak delights,
I am sinking, merely sinking
I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe
I'm a singer without a song
my affection is stronger
and I 
 I was just thinking, merely thinking
that this boat is sinking
I'm tired of postcards, especially the ones with cute dogs and cupids
I'm tired of calling you and missing you and dreaming I slept with you
Don't get me wrong I still desperately love you
inside this weary head
I just want us to love just instead
I think about long distance rates instead of kissing you babe
and time is running me still
If I wait for you longer
my affection is stronger
I 
 I was just thinking
I 
thinking of long distance rates instead of kissing you
So baby I'm sinking,
merely sinking
Thank you
Singing is sharing
 When you sing, you have to know what you're talking about intimately, and you have to be willing to share this insight and give away a piece of yourself
 I look for this intention to share in everything, and I ask: what are the intentions behind this architecture or this product or this restaurant or this meal? And if your intentions are to impress people or to get the big applause at the end, then you are taking, not giving
And this is a song that's about -- it's the kind of song that everyone has their version of
Home is the sound of birds early in the morning
Home is the memory of my first day in school
Home is the books that I carry around
Home is an alley in a faraway town
Home is the places I’ve been and where I’d like to go
Home
I'm always gonna feel at home
I’m always gonna feel this longing
No matter where I might stay
Home is a feather twirling in the air
Home is all the things she said to me
Home is a photo I never threw away
Home is the smile on my face when I die
I met a woman, she always lived in the same place
And he said home is where you want to be
I met a girl in some downtown bar
And she said I'll have whatever he's having
And I asked her how come we never met before?
to get a place of my own
No matter where I may roam
Always gonna find my way back home
No matter how far I’m gone
I'm always gonna feel this longing
No matter where I might stay
Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells? There's still some confusion about that question, as this is a fairly new field of research
 For example, I was talking to one of my colleagues, Robert, who is an oncologist, and he was telling me, "Sandrine, this is puzzling
 Some of my patients that have been told they are cured of their cancer still develop symptoms of depression
" And I responded to him, "Well, from my point of view that makes sense
 The drug you give to your patients that stops the cancer cells multiplying also stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain
" And then Robert looked at me like I was crazy and said, "But Sandrine, these are adult patients -- adults do not grow new nerve cells
" And much to his surprise, I said, "Well actually, we do
" And this is a phenomenon that we call neurogenesis
[Neurogenesis]
Now Robert is not a neuroscientist, and when he went to medical school he was not taught what we know now -- that the adult brain can generate new nerve cells
 So Robert, you know, being the good doctor that he is, wanted to come to my lab to understand the topic a little bit better
 And I took him for a tour of one of the most exciting parts of the brain when it comes to neurogenesis -- and this is the hippocampus
 So this is this gray structure in the center of the brain
 And what we've known already for very long, is that this is important for learning, memory, mood and emotion
 However, what we have learned more recently is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain where new neurons can be generated
 And if we slice through the hippocampus and zoom in, what you actually see here in blue is a newborn neuron in an adult mouse brain
 So when it comes to the human brain -- my colleague Jonas Frisén from the Karolinska Institutet, has estimated that we produce 700 new neurons per day in the hippocampus
 You might think this is not much, compared to the billions of neurons we have
 But by the time we turn 50, we will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure with adult-born neurons
So why are these new neurons important and what are their functions? First, we know that they're important for learning and memory
 And in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability of the adult brain to produce new neurons in the hippocampus, then we block certain memory abilities
We are still learning a lot, and neurons are not only important for memory capacity, but also for the quality of the memory
 And they will have been helpful to add time to our memory and they will help differentiate very similar memories, like: how do you find your bike that you park at the station every day in the same area, but in a slightly different position?
And more interesting to my colleague Robert is the research we have been doing on neurogenesis and depression
 So in an animal model of depression, we have seen that we have a lower level of neurogenesis
 And if we give antidepressants, then we increase the production of these newborn neurons, and we decrease the symptoms of depression, establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression
 So by then, Robert had understood that very likely his patients were suffering from depression even after being cured of their cancer, because the cancer drug had stopped newborn neurons from being generated
 And it will take time to generate new neurons that reach normal functions
So, collectively, now we think we have enough evidence to say that neurogenesis is a target of choice if we want to improve memory formation or mood, or even prevent the decline associated with aging, or associated with stress
So the next question is: can we control neurogenesis? The answer is yes
 And we are now going to do a little quiz
 I'm going to give you a set of behaviors and activities, and you tell me if you think they will increase neurogenesis or if they will decrease neurogenesis
 Are we ready? OK, let's go
So what about learning? Increasing? Yes
 Learning will increase the production of these new neurons
How about sleep deprivation? Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis
How about sex? Oh, wow!
Yes, you are right, it will increase the production of new neurons
 However, it's all about balance here
 We don't want to fall in a situation --
about too much sex leading to sleep deprivation
How about getting older? So the neurogenesis rate will decrease as we get older, but it is still occurring
And then finally, how about running? I will let you judge that one by yourself
So this is one of the first studies that was carried out by one of my mentors, Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute, showing that the environment can have an impact on the production of new neurons
 And here you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse that had no running wheel in its cage
 And the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons-to-be
 So you see the massive increase of the black dots representing the new neurons-to-be
So activity impacts neurogenesis, but that's not all
 What you eat will have an effect on the production of new neurons in the hippocampus
 And I'm just going to point a few out to you: Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent will increase neurogenesis
 Intermittent fasting -- spacing the time between your meals -- will increase neurogenesis
 Intake of flavonoids, which are contained in dark chocolate or blueberries, will increase neurogenesis
 Omega-3 fatty acids, present in fatty fish, like salmon, will increase the production of these new neurons
 Conversely, a diet rich in high saturated fat will have a negative impact on neurogenesis
 Ethanol -- intake of alcohol -- will decrease neurogenesis
 However, not everything is lost; resveratrol, which is contained in red wine, has been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons
And then finally, let me point out the last one -- a quirky one
 So Japanese groups are fascinated with food textures, and they have shown that actually soft diet impairs neurogenesis, as opposed to food that requires mastication -- chewing -- or crunchy food
So all of this data, where we need to look at the cellular level, has been generated using animal models
 So we think that the effect of diet on mental health, on memory and mood, is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus
 And it's not only what you eat, but it's also the texture of the food, when you eat it and how much of it you eat
On our side -- neuroscientists interested in neurogenesis -- we need to understand better the function of these new neurons, and how we can control their survival and their production
 And on your side -- I leave you in charge of your neurogenesis
Thank you
 Now, I told you you changed my life -- I now eat a lot of blueberries
 Very good
 I'm really interested in the running thing
 Do I have to run? Or is it really just about aerobic exercise, getting oxygen to the brain? Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise?
 So for the moment, we can't really say if it's just the running itself, but we think that anything that indeed will increase the production -- or moving the blood flow to the brain, should be beneficial
 So I don't have to get a running wheel in my office?
 No, you don't!
 Oh, what a relief! That's wonderful
 Thank you, Margaret
Two twin domes, two radically opposed design cultures
 One is made of thousands of steel parts, the other of a single silk thread
 One is synthetic, the other organic
 One is imposed on the environment, the other creates it
 One is designed for nature, the other is designed by her
 The chisel was Michelangelo's only tool
 But living things are not chiseled
 They grow
Tools also have consequences
 At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production
But you don't find homogenous material assemblies in nature
 Take human skin, for example
 Our facial skins are thin with large pores
 One acts mainly as filter, the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same skin: no parts, no assemblies
 It's a system that gradually varies its functionality by varying elasticity
 These two worldviews, my left brain and right brain, analysis and synthesis, will play out on the two screens behind me
 My work, at its simplest level, is about uniting these two worldviews, moving away from assembly and closer into growth
You're probably asking yourselves: Why now? Why was this not possible 10 or even five years ago? We live in a very special time in history, a rare time, a time when the confluence of four fields is giving designers access to tools we've never had access to before
 These fields are computational design, allowing us to design complex forms with simple code; additive manufacturing, letting us produce parts by adding material rather than carving it out; materials engineering, which lets us design the behavior of materials in high resolution; and synthetic biology, enabling us to design new biological functionality by editing DNA
 And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create
 Please meet the minds and hands of my students
We design objects and products and structures and tools across scales, from the large-scale, like this robotic arm with an 80-foot diameter reach with a vehicular base that will one day soon print entire buildings, to nanoscale graphics made entirely of genetically engineered microorganisms that glow in the dark
 Here we've reimagined the mashrabiya, an archetype of ancient Arabic architecture, and created a screen where every aperture is uniquely sized to shape the form of light and heat moving through it
 Together with my long-term 3D printing collaborator Stratasys, we 3D-printed this cape and skirt with no seams between the cells, and I'll show more objects like it
 This helmet combines stiff and soft materials in 20-micron resolution
 This is the resolution of a human hair
 It's also the resolution of a CT scanner
 That designers have access to such high-resolution analytic and synthetic tools, enables to design products that fit not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological makeup of our tissues
 Next, we designed an acoustic chair, a chair that would be at once structural, comfortable and would also absorb sound
 Professor Carter, my collaborator, and I turned to nature for inspiration, and by designing this irregular surface pattern, it becomes sound-absorbent
 We printed its surface out of 44 different properties, varying in rigidity, opacity and color, corresponding to pressure points on the human body
 Its surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not by adding another material or another assembly, but by continuously and delicately varying material property
 As she recounts: "On the third day of Creation, God commands the Earth to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree
 I often ask myself, "What would design be like if objects were made of a single part? Would we return to a better state of creation?"
 So that's what we did
 We called Legal Seafood --
we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells, we grinded them and we produced chitosan paste
 In order to print the structures in large scale, we built a robotically controlled extrusion system with multiple nozzles
 So why are we still designing with plastics? The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain photosynthetic microorganisms that first appeared on our planet 3
5 billion year ago, as we learned yesterday
 Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we embedded bacteria that were genetically engineered to rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere and convert it into sugar
 For the first time, we were able to generate structures that would seamlessly transition from beam to mesh, and if scaled even larger, to windows
 A fruit-bearing fruit tree
 Working with an ancient material, one of the first lifeforms on the planet, plenty of water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we were able to transform a structure made of shrimp shells into an architecture that behaves like a tree
 And here's the best part: for objects designed to biodegrade, put them in the sea, and they will nourish marine life; place them in soil, and they will help grow a tree
The setting for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system
 We looked for the possibility of creating life-sustaining clothing for interplanetary voyages
 To do that, we needed to contain bacteria and be able to control their flow
 So like the periodic table, we came up with our own table of the elements: new lifeforms that were computationally grown, additively manufactured and biologically augmented
 I like to think of synthetic biology as liquid alchemy, only instead of transmuting precious metals, you're synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels
 It's called microfluidics
 We 3D-printed our own channels in order to control the flow of these liquid bacterial cultures
 In our first piece of clothing, we combined two microorganisms
 The first is cyanobacteria
 It lives in our oceans and in freshwater ponds
 And the second, E
 coli, the bacterium that inhabits the human gut
 One converts light into sugar, the other consumes that sugar and produces biofuels useful for the built environment
 Now, these two microorganisms never interact in nature
 In fact, they never met each other
 Think of it as evolution not by natural selection, but evolution by design
 In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that resembles the digestive tract, that will help flow these bacteria and alter their function along the way
 We then started growing these channels on the human body, varying material properties according to the desired functionality
 This wearable digestive system, when it's stretched end to end, spans 60 meters
 This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times as long as our small intestines
Thank you
Mary Shelley said, "We are unfashioned creatures, but only half made up
" What if design could provide that other half? What if we could create structures that would augment living matter? What if we could create personal microbiomes that would scan our skins, repair damaged tissue and sustain our bodies? Think of this as a form of edited biology
 This entire collection, Wanderers, that was named after planets, was not to me really about fashion per se, but it provided an opportunity to speculate about the future of our race on our planet and beyond, to combine scientific insight with lots of mystery and to move away from the age of the machine to a new age of symbiosis between our bodies, the microorganisms that we inhabit, our products and even our buildings
 I call this material ecology
To do this, we always need to return back to nature
 By now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers
 You also know that nature doesn't
 It grows
 It adds with sophistication
 This silkworm cocoon, for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside which to metamorphisize
 No additive manufacturing today gets even close to this level of sophistication
 One acts as the structure, the other is the glue, or the matrix, holding those fibers together
 And this happens across scales
 The silkworm first attaches itself to the environment -- it creates a tensile structure -- and it then starts spinning a compressive cocoon
 Tension and compression, the two forces of life, manifested in a single material
In order to better understand how this complex process works, we glued a tiny earth magnet to the head of a silkworm, to the spinneret
 We placed it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this 3-dimensional point cloud and visualize the complex architecture of the silkworm cocoon
 So we started designing different environments, different scaffolds, and we discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the cocoon, was directly informed by the environment
 We realized that designing these templates allowed us to give shape to raw silk without boiling a single cocoon
They would healthily metamorphisize, and we would be able to create these things
So we scaled this process up to architectural scale
 We had a robot spin the template out of silk, and we placed it on our site
 We then created holes, or apertures, that would lock in the rays of light and heat, distributing those silkworms on the structure
We were ready to receive the caterpillars
 And after four weeks of feeding, they were ready to spin with us
 We placed them carefully at the bottom rim of the scaffold, and as they spin they pupate, they mate, they lay eggs, and life begins all over again -- just like us but much, much shorter
Bucky Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right
 As they spin biological silk over robotically spun silk, they give this entire pavilion its integrity
 And over two to three weeks, 6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers
 The moths, after they hatch, produce 1
5 million eggs
 This could be used for 250 additional pavilions for the future
So here they are, the two worldviews
If the final frontier of design is to breathe life into the products and the buildings around us, to form a two-material ecology, then designers must unite these two worldviews
Thank you very much
 Thank you
 But before I do that, I want to talk a little bit about the past
 Now, throughout much of the recent history of medicine, we've thought about illness and treatment in terms of a profoundly simple model
Now, the reason for the dominance of this model is of course the antibiotic revolution
 Many of you might not know this, but we happen to be celebrating the hundredth year of the introduction of antibiotics into the United States
 But what you do know is that that introduction was nothing short of transformative
 Here you had a chemical, either from the natural world or artificially synthesized in the laboratory, and it would course through your body, it would find its target, lock into its target -- a microbe or some part of a microbe -- and then turn off a lock and a key with exquisite deftness, exquisite specificity
 And you would end up taking a previously fatal, lethal disease -- a pneumonia, syphilis, tuberculosis -- and transforming that into a curable, or treatable illness
 You have a pneumonia, you take penicillin, you kill the microbe and you cure the disease
So seductive was this idea, so potent the metaphor of lock and key and killing something, that it really swept through biology
 It was a transformation like no other
 And we've really spent the last 100 years trying to replicate that model over and over again in noninfectious diseases, in chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension and heart disease
 And it's worked, but it's only worked partly
 Let me show you
 You know, if you take the entire universe of all chemical reactions in the human body, every chemical reaction that your body is capable of, most people think that that number is on the order of a million
 Let's call it a million
 And now you ask the question, what number or fraction of reactions can actually be targeted by the entire pharmacopoeia, all of medicinal chemistry? That number is 250
 The rest is chemical darkness
025 percent of all chemical reactions in your body are actually targetable by this lock and key mechanism
 You know, if you think about human physiology as a vast global telephone network with interacting nodes and interacting pieces, then all of our medicinal chemistry is operating on one tiny corner at the edge, the outer edge, of that network
 It's like all of our pharmaceutical chemistry is a pole operator in Wichita, Kansas who is tinkering with about 10 or 15 telephone lines
So what do we do about this idea? What if we reorganized this approach? In fact, it turns out that the natural world gives us a sense of how one might think about illness in a radically different way, rather than disease, medicine, target
 These self-regulating, semi-autonomous units give rise to self-regulating, semi-autonomous units called organs, and these organs coalesce to form things called humans, and these organisms ultimately live in environments, which are partly self-regulating and partly semi-autonomous
What's nice about this scheme, this hierarchical scheme building upwards rather than downwards, is that it allows us to think about illness as well in a somewhat different way
 Take a disease like cancer
 Since the 1950s, we've tried rather desperately to apply this lock and key model to cancer
 It's worked for diseases like leukemia
 It's worked for some forms of breast cancer, but eventually you run to the ceiling of that approach
 And it's only in the last 10 years or so that we've begun to think about using the immune system, remembering that in fact the cancer cell doesn't grow in a vacuum
 It actually grows in a human organism
 And could you use the organismal capacity, the fact that human beings have an immune system, to attack cancer? In fact, it's led to the some of the most spectacular new medicines in cancer
 But let me give you an example of a profoundly carcinogenic environment
 It's called a prison
 You take loneliness, you take depression, you take confinement, and you add to that, rolled up in a little white sheet of paper, one of the most potent neurostimulants that we know, called nicotine, and you add to that one of the most potent addictive substances that you know, and you have a pro-carcinogenic environment
 But you can have anti-carcinogenic environments too
 We're trying to change the metabolic milieu for other forms of cancer
 Again, working upwards, since the 1960s and 1970s, we've tried, again, desperately to turn off molecules that operate between nerve cells -- serotonin, dopamine -- and tried to cure depression that way, and that's worked, but then that reached the limit
 And we now know that what you really probably need to do is to change the physiology of the organ, the brain, rewire it, remodel it, and that, of course, we know study upon study has shown that talk therapy does exactly that, and study upon study has shown that talk therapy combined with medicines, pills, really is much more effective than either one alone
 Can we imagine a more immersive environment that will change depression? Can you lock out the signals that elicit depression? Again, moving upwards along this hierarchical chain of organization
 What's really at stake perhaps here is not the medicine itself but a metaphor
 Rather than killing something, in the case of the great chronic degenerative diseases -- kidney failure, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis -- maybe what we really need to do is change the metaphor to growing something
 And that's the key, perhaps, to reframing our thinking about medicine
Now, this idea of changing, of creating a perceptual shift, as it were, came home to me to roost in a very personal manner about 10 years ago
 About 10 years ago -- I've been a runner most of my life -- I went for a run, a Saturday morning run, I came back and woke up and I basically couldn't move
 And one of the perks of being a physician is that you get to order your own MRIs
 Essentially, the meniscus of cartilage that is between bone had been completely torn and the bone itself had been shattered
Now, if you're looking at me and feeling sorry, let me tell you a few facts
 If I was to take an MRI of every person in this audience, 60 percent of you would show signs of bone degeneration and cartilage degeneration like this
 50 to 60 percent of the men in this audience would also have such signs
 So about 10 years ago we began, we brought this process into the laboratory, and we began to do simple experiments, mechanically trying to fix this degeneration
 We tried to inject chemicals into the knee spaces of animals to try to reverse cartilage degeneration, and to put a short summary on a very long and painful process, essentially it came to naught
 And then about seven years ago, we had a research student from Australia
 The nice thing about Australians is that they're habitually used to looking at the world upside down
 Maybe it isn't a chemical problem
 Maybe it's a stem cell problem
" In other words, he had two hypotheses
 And two, that maybe that, the degeneration or dysfunction of this stem cell is what's causing osteochondral arthritis, a very common ailment
 So really the question was, were we looking for a pill when we should have really been looking for a cell
 So we switched our models, and now we began to look for skeletal stem cells
 And to cut again a long story short, about five years ago, we found these cells
 They live inside the skeleton
 Here's a schematic and then a real photograph of one of them
 The white stuff is bone, and these red columns that you see and the yellow cells are cells that have arisen from one single skeletal stem cell -- columns of cartilage, columns of bone coming out of a single cell
 These cells are fascinating
 They have four properties
 Number one is that they live where they're expected to live
 They live just underneath the surface of the bone, underneath cartilage
 And they move into the appropriate areas and form bone and cartilage
 That's one
 Here's an interesting property
 You can take them out of the vertebrate skeleton, you can culture them in petri dishes in the laboratory, and they are dying to form cartilage
 Remember how we couldn't form cartilage for love or money? These cells are dying to form cartilage
 They form their own furls of cartilage around themselves
 They're also, number three, the most efficient repairers of fractures that we've ever encountered
 These stem cells have come in and repaired, in yellow, the bone, in white, the cartilage, almost completely
 So much so that if you label them with a fluorescent dye you can see them like some kind of peculiar cellular glue coming into the area of a fracture, fixing it locally and then stopping their work
 Now, the fourth one is the most ominous, and that is that their numbers decline precipitously, precipitously, tenfold, fiftyfold, as you age
And so what had happened, really, is that we found ourselves in a perceptual shift
 We had gone hunting for pills but we ended up finding theories
 And in some ways we had hooked ourselves back onto this idea: cells, organisms, environments, because we were now thinking about bone stem cells, we were thinking about arthritis in terms of a cellular disease
And then the next question was, are there organs? Can you build this as an organ outside the body? Can you implant cartilage into areas of trauma? And perhaps most interestingly, can you ascend right up and create environments? You know, we know that exercise remodels bone, but come on, none of us is going to exercise
 So could you imagine ways of passively loading and unloading bone so that you can recreate or regenerate degenerating cartilage?
And perhaps more interesting, and more importantly, the question is, can you apply this model more globally outside medicine? What's at stake, as I said before, is not killing something, but growing something
 And it raises a series of, I think, some of the most interesting questions about how we think about medicine in the future
 Could your medicine be a cell and not a pill? How would we grow these cells? What we would we do to stop the malignant growth of these cells? We heard about the problems of unleashing growth
 How could we implant those memories back in? Could we store these organs? Would each organ have to be developed for an individual human being and put back? And perhaps most puzzlingly, could your medicine be an environment? Could you patent an environment? You know, in every culture, shamans have been using environments as medicines
 Could we imagine that for our future? I've talked a lot about models
 So let me end with some thoughts about model building
 That's what we do as scientists
 You know, when an architect builds a model, he or she is trying to show you a world in miniature
 But when a scientist is building a model, he or she is trying to show you the world in metaphor
 He or she is trying to create a new way of seeing
 The former is a scale shift
 The latter is a perceptual shift
Now, antibiotics created such a perceptual shift in our way of thinking about medicine that it really colored, distorted, very successfully, the way we've thought about medicine for the last hundred years
 But we need new models to think about medicine in the future
 That's what's at stake
You know, there's a popular trope out there that the reason we haven't had the transformative impact on the treatment of illness is because we don't have powerful-enough drugs, and that's partly true
 But perhaps the real reason is that we don't have powerful-enough ways of thinking about medicines
 It's certainly true that it would be lovely to have new medicines
Thank you
 I really like this metaphor
 How does it link in? There's a lot of talk in technologyland about the personalization of medicine, that we have all this data and that medical treatments of the future will be for you specifically, your genome, your current context
 Does that apply to this model you've got here?
 It's a very interesting question
 We've thought about personalization of medicine very much in terms of genomics
 That's because the gene is such a dominant metaphor, again, to use that same word, in medicine today, that we think the genome will drive the personalization of medicine
 But of course the genome is just the bottom of a long chain of being, as it were
 That chain of being, really the first organized unit of that, is the cell
 So I think at every stage, you know -- there's that metaphor, there's turtles all the way
 Well, in this, there's personalization all the way
 So when you say medicine could be a cell and not a pill, you're talking about potentially your own cells
 Absolutely
 And there's no perhaps
 This is what we're doing
 Thank you so much
 Pleasure
 Thanks
Over our lifetimes, we've all contributed to climate change
 Actions, choices and behaviors will have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions
 And I think that that's quite a powerful thought
 But it does have the potential to make us feel guilty when we think about decisions we might have made around where to travel to, how often and how, about the energy that we choose to use in our homes or in our workplaces, or quite simply the lifestyles that we lead and enjoy
 But we can also turn that thought on its head, and think that if we've had such a profound but a negative impact on our climate already, then we have an opportunity to influence the amount of future climate change that we will need to adapt to
So we have a choice
 We can either choose to start to take climate change seriously, and significantly cut and mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions, and then we will have to adapt to less of the climate change impacts in future
 Alternatively, we can continue to really ignore the climate change problem
 And not only that
 As people who live in countries with high per capita emissions, we're making that choice on behalf of others as well
 But the choice that we don't have is a no climate change future
Over the last two decades, our government negotiators and policymakers have been coming together to discuss climate change, and they've been focused on avoiding a two-degree centigrade warming above pre-industrial levels
 That's the temperature that's associated with dangerous impacts across a range of different indicators, to humans and to the environment
 So two degrees centigrade constitutes dangerous climate change
But dangerous climate change can be subjective
 So if we think about an extreme weather event that might happen in some part of the world, and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure, where there are people that are well-insured and so on, then that impact can be disruptive
 It can cause upset, it could cause cost
 It could even cause some deaths
 But if that exact same weather event happens in a part of the world where there is poor infrastructure, or where people are not well-insured, or they're not having good support networks, then that same climate change impact could be devastating
 It could cause a significant loss of home, but it could also cause significant amounts of death
So this is a graph of the CO2 emissions at the left-hand side from fossil fuel and industry, and time from before the Industrial Revolution out towards the present day
 And what's immediately striking about this is that emissions have been growing exponentially
 And then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event
 And if we focus on our historical emission trend in recent years, and we put that together with our understanding of the direction of travel in our global economy, then we are much more on track for a four-degree centigrade global warming than we are for the two-degree centigrade
Now, let's just pause for a moment and think about this four-degree global average temperature
 Most of our planet is actually made up of the sea
 Now, because the sea has a greater thermal inertia than the land, the average temperatures over land are actually going to be higher than they are over the sea
 The second thing is that we as human beings don't experience global average temperatures
 We experience hot days, cold days, rainy days, especially if you live in Manchester like me
So now put yourself in a city center
 Imagine somewhere in the world: Mumbai, Beijing, New York, London
 It's the hottest day that you've ever experienced
 There's sun beating down, there's concrete and glass all around you
 So our roads and our rail networks have been designed to last for a long time and withstand only certain amounts of impacts in different parts of the world
 And this is going to be extremely challenged
 Our power stations are expected to be cooled by water to a certain temperature to remain effective and resilient
 And our buildings are designed to be comfortable within a particular temperature range
 And this is all going to be significantly challenged under a four-degree-type scenario
 Our infrastructure has not been designed to cope with this
So if we go back, also thinking about four degrees, it's not just the direct impacts, but also some indirect impacts
 So if we take food security, for example
 Maize and wheat yields in some parts of the world are expected to be up to 40 percent lower under a four-degree scenario, rice up to 30 percent lower
 So all in all, the kinds of impacts anticipated under this four-degree centigrade scenario are going to be incompatible with global organized living
So back to our trajectories and our graphs of four degrees and two degrees
 But I would just like to draw on my own research on energy systems, on food systems, aviation and also shipping, just to say that I think there is still a small fighting chance of avoiding this two-degree dangerous climate change
So if you focus in on this trajectory and these graphs, the yellow circle there highlights that the departure from the red four-degree pathway to the two-degree green pathway is immediate
 And that's because of cumulative emissions, or the carbon budget
 So in other words, because of the lights and the projectors that are on in this room right now, the CO2 that is going into our atmosphere as a result of that electricity consumption lasts a very long time
 It will accumulate, and greenhouse gases tend to be cumulative
 And that tells us something about these trajectories
 First of all, it tells us that it's the area under these curves that matter, not where we reach at a particular date in future
 And that's important, because it doesn't matter if we come up with some amazing whiz-bang technology to sort out our energy problem on the last day of 2049, just in the nick of time to sort things out
 Because in the meantime, emissions will have accumulated
 So if we continue on this red, four-degree centigrade scenario pathway, the longer we continue on it, that will need to be made up for in later years to keep the same carbon budget, to keep the same area under the curve, which means that that trajectory, the red one there, becomes steeper
 So in other words, if we don't reduce emissions in the short to medium term, then we'll have to make more significant year-on-year emission reductions
 We also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system
 But if we don't start to cut emissions in the short to medium term, then we will have to do that even sooner
The other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy
 So it doesn't matter whether we choose nuclear power or carbon capture and storage, upscale our biofuel production, or go for a much bigger roll-out of wind turbines and wave turbines
 All of that will take time
 And if we do that, that also means that as we continue to roll out the supply-side technology, we will have less of a job to do if we've actually managed to reduce our energy consumption, because we will then need less infrastructure on the supply side
Another issue that we really need to grapple with is the issue of well-being and equity
 There are many parts of the world where the standard of living needs to rise
 Bbut with energy systems currently reliant on fossil fuel, as those economies grow so will emissions
 And now, if we're all constrained by the same amount of carbon budget, that means that if some parts of the world's emissions are needing to rise, then other parts of the world's emissions need to reduce
 Because according to our research, if you're in a country where per capita emissions are really high -- so North America, Europe, Australia -- emissions reductions of the order of 10 percent per year, and starting immediately, will be required for a good chance of avoiding the two-degree target
 Let me just put that into context
 The economist Nicholas Stern said that emission reductions of more than one percent per year had only ever been associated with economic recession or upheaval
 So this poses huge challenges for the issue of economic growth, because if we have our high carbon infrastructure in place, it means that if our economies grow, then so do our emissions
 So I'd just like to take a quote from a paper by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011 where we said that to avoid the two-degree framing of dangerous climate change, economic growth needs to be exchanged at least temporarily for a period of planned austerity in wealthy nations
This is a really difficult message to take, because what it suggests is that we really need to do things differently
 This is not about just incremental change
 This is about doing things differently, about whole system change, and sometimes it's about doing less things
 So it could be from writing to our local politician to talking to our boss at work or being the boss at work, or talking with our friends and family, or, quite simply, changing our lifestyles
 At the moment, we're choosing a four-degree scenario
 If we really want to avoid the two-degree scenario, there really is no time like the present to act
Thank you
 Alice, basically what you're saying, the talk is, unless wealthy nations start cutting 10 percent per year the emissions now, this year, not in 2020 or '25, we are going to go straight to the four-plus-degree scenario
 So they make kind of heroic assumptions about that
 The more we do that, because it's the cumulative emissions, the short-term stuff that really matters
 So it does make a huge difference
 If a big country like China, for example, continues to grow even for just a few extra years, that will make a big difference to when we need to decarbonize
 So I don't think we can even say when it will be, because it all depends on what we have to do in the short term
 But I think we've just got huge scope, and we don't pull those levers that allow us to reduce the energy demand, which is a shame
 Alice, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this data
 Thank you
Raise your hand if you've ever been asked the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
Now if you had to guess, how old would you say you were when you were first asked this question? You can just hold up fingers
 Three
 Five
 Three
 Five
 Five
 OK
 Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?" has ever caused you any anxiety
See, the problem wasn't that I didn't have any interests -- it's that I had too many
 In high school, I liked English and math and art and I built websites and I played guitar in a punk band called Frustrated Telephone Operator
This continued after high school, and at a certain point, I began to notice this pattern in myself where I would become interested in an area and I would dive in, become all-consumed, and I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was, and then I would hit this point where I'd start to get bored
 And usually I would try and persist anyway, because I had already devoted so much time and energy and sometimes money into this field
 But eventually this sense of boredom, this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this, this isn't challenging anymore -- it would get to be too much
 And I would have to let it go
But then I would become interested in something else, something totally unrelated, and I would dive into that, and become all-consumed, and I'd be like, "Yes! I found my thing," and then I would hit this point again where I'd start to get bored
 And eventually, I would let it go
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons
 I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing, deny all of my other passions, and just resign myself to being bored
 The other reason it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal
 I worried that I was afraid of commitment, or that I was scattered, or that I was self-sabotaging, afraid of my own success
If you can relate to my story and to these feelings, I'd like you to ask yourself a question that I wish I had asked myself back then
 Ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things
 I'll tell you where you learned it: you learned it from the culture
We are first asked the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?" when we're about five years old
 And the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that age
It's considered an innocuous question, posed to little kids to elicit cute replies, like, "I want to be an astronaut," or "I want to be a ballerina," or "I want to be a pirate
But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms -- for instance, high school students might get asked what major they're going to pick in college
 And at some point, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" goes from being the cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night
 Why?
 In fact, it does just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't reply with 20 different things, though well-meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be a violin maker and a psychologist
 You have to choose
This is Dr
 Bob Childs --
and he's a luthier and psychotherapist
 And this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor turned illustrator, entrepreneur, teacher and creative director
 All they hear is that they're going to have to choose
 But it's more than that
 The notion of the narrowly focused life is highly romanticized in our culture
 It's this idea of destiny or the one true calling, the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do during our time on this earth, and you need to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it
But what if you're someone who isn't wired this way? What if there are a lot of different subjects that you're curious about, and many different things you want to do? Well, there is no room for someone like you in this framework
 And so you might feel alone
 You might feel like you don't have a purpose
 And you might feel like there's something wrong with you
 What you are is a multipotentialite
A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits
 It's a mouthful to say
 It might help if you break it up into three parts: multi, potential, and ite
 Actually, during the Renaissance period, it was considered the ideal to be well-versed in multiple disciplines
 Barbara Sher refers to us as "scanners
" Use whichever term you like, or invent your own
It's easy to see your multipotentiality as a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome
 Here are three multipotentialite super powers
 idea synthesis
 That is, combining two or more fields and creating something new at the intersection
 Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests in cartography, data visualization, travel, mathematics and design, when they founded Meshu
 Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically-inspired jewelry
 Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea not despite, but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences
 Innovation happens at the intersections
 That's where the new ideas come from
 And multipotentialites, with all of their backgrounds, are able to access a lot of these points of intersection
The second multipotentialite superpower is rapid learning
 When multipotentialites become interested in something, we go hard
 We observe everything we can get our hands on
 We're also used to being beginners, because we've been beginners so many times in the past, and this means that we're less afraid of trying new things and stepping out of our comfort zones
 What's more, many skills are transferable across disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue, so we're rarely starting from scratch
Nora Dunn is a full-time traveler and freelance writer
 Now, she's the fastest typist she knows
Before becoming a writer, Nora was a financial planner
 She had to learn the finer mechanics of sales when she was starting her practice, and this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors
 It is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're drawn to, even if you end up quitting
 You might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely, in a way that you couldn't have anticipated
 Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director, sometimes a web designer, sometimes a Kickstarter consultant, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James Bond
He's valuable because he does good work
 Fast Company magazine identified adaptability as the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive in the 21st century
 The economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably that it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive
Idea synthesis, rapid learning and adaptability: three skills that multipotentialites are very adept at, and three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus
 As a society, we have a vested interest in encouraging multipotentialites to be themselves
 We have a lot of complex, multidimensional problems in the world right now, and we need creative, out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them
Now, let's say that you are, in your heart, a specialist
 Don't worry -- there's nothing wrong with you, either
In fact, some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and multipotentialite paired together
 It's a beautiful partnership
 But we should all be designing lives and careers that are aligned with how we're wired
 And sadly, multipotentialites are largely being encouraged simply to be more like their specialist peers
So with that said, if there is one thing you take away from this talk, I hope that it is this: embrace your inner wiring, whatever that may be
 If you're a specialist at heart, then by all means, specialize
 That is where you'll do your best work
 embrace your many passions
 Follow your curiosity down those rabbit holes
 Explore your intersections
 Embracing our inner wiring leads to a happier, more authentic life
 And perhaps more importantly -- multipotentialites, the world needs us
Thank you
Imagine being unable to say, "I am hungry," "I am in pain," "thank you," or "I love you
" Being trapped inside your body, a body that doesn't respond to commands
 Surrounded by people, yet utterly alone
 Wishing you could reach out, to connect, to comfort, to participate
 For 13 long years, that was my reality
Most of us never think twice about talking, about communicating
 I've thought a lot about it
 However, I progressively got worse
 Eventually, I lost my ability to control my movements, make eye contact, and finally, my ability to speak
While in hospital, I desperately wanted to go home
 I said to my mother, "When home?" Those were the last words I ever spoke with my own voice
 I would eventually fail every test for mental awareness
 My parents were told I was as good as not there
 A vegetable, having the intelligence of a three-month-old baby
 They were told to take me home and try to keep me comfortable until I died
My parents, in fact my entire family's lives, became consumed by taking care of me the best they knew how
 Their friends drifted away
 One year turned to two, two turned to three
 It seemed like the person I once was began to disappear
 The Lego blocks and electronic circuits I'd loved as a boy were put away
 I had been moved out of my bedroom into another more practical one
 I had become a ghost, a faded memory of a boy people once knew and loved
Meanwhile, my mind began knitting itself back together
 Gradually, my awareness started to return
 But no one realized that I had come back to life
 I was aware of everything, just like any normal person
 I could see and understand everything, but I couldn't find a way to let anybody know
 My personality was entombed within a seemingly silent body, a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight within a chrysalis
The stark reality hit me that I was going to spend the rest of my life locked inside myself, totally alone
 I was trapped with only my thoughts for company
 I would never be rescued
 No one would ever show me tenderness
 No one would ever love me
 I had no dreams, no hope, nothing to look forward to
 Well, nothing pleasant
 I lived in fear, and, to put it bluntly, was waiting for death to finally release me, expecting to die all alone in a care home
I don't know if it's truly possible to express in words what it's like not to be able to communicate
 Your personality appears to vanish into a heavy fog and all of your emotions and desires are constricted, stifled and muted within you
 For me, the worst was the feeling of utter powerlessness
 I simply existed
 It's a very dark place to find yourself because in a sense, you have vanished
 Other people controlled every aspect of my life
 They decided what I ate and when
 Whether I was laid on my side or strapped into my wheelchair
 I often spent my days positioned in front of the TV watching Barney reruns
 I think because Barney is so happy and jolly, and I absolutely wasn't, it made it so much worse
I was completely powerless to change anything in my life or people's perceptions of me
 I was a silent, invisible observer of how people behaved when they thought no one was watching
 Unfortunately, I wasn't only an observer
 With no way to communicate, I became the perfect victim: a defenseless object, seemingly devoid of feelings that people used to play out their darkest desires
 For more than 10 years, people who were charged with my care abused me physically, verbally and sexually
 Despite what they thought, I did feel
 The first time it happened, I was shocked and filled with disbelief
 How could they do this to me? I was confused
 What had I done to deserve this? Part of me wanted to cry and another part wanted to fight
 Hurt, sadness and anger flooded through me
 There was no one to comfort me
 But neither of my parents knew this was happening
 I just never knew when
 All I knew was that I would never be the same
 I remember once listening to Whitney Houston singing, "No matter what they take from me, they can't take away my dignity
" And I thought to myself, "You want to bet?"
Perhaps my parents could have found out and could have helped
 But the years of constant caretaking, having to wake up every two hours to turn me, combined with them essentially grieving the loss of their son, had taken a toll on my mother and father
 Following yet another heated argument between my parents, in a moment of despair and desperation, my mother turned to me and told me that I should die
 I was shocked, but as I thought about what she had said, I was filled with enormous compassion and love for my mother, yet I could do nothing about it
There were many moments when I gave up, sinking into a dark abyss
 I remember one particularly low moment
 My dad left me alone in the car while he quickly went to buy something from the store
 A random stranger walked past, looked at me and he smiled
 I may never know why, but that simple act, the fleeting moment of human connection, transformed how I was feeling, making me want to keep going
My existence was tortured by monotony, a reality that was often too much to bear
 Alone with my thoughts, I constructed intricate fantasies about ants running across the floor
 As I learned how the shadows moved as the hours of the day passed, I understood how long it would be before I was picked up and taken home
 Seeing my father walk through the door to collect me was the best moment of the day
My mind became a tool that I could use to either close down to retreat from my reality or enlarge into a gigantic space that I could fill with fantasies
 I hoped that my reality would change and someone would see that I had come back to life
 But I had been washed away like a sand castle built too close to the waves, and in my place was the person people expected me to be
 To some I was Martin, a vacant shell, the vegetable, deserving of harsh words, dismissal and even abuse
 To others, I was the tragically brain-damaged boy who had grown to become a man
 Good or bad, I was a blank canvas onto which different versions of myself were projected
It took someone new to see me in a different way
 Whether through intuition or her attention to details that others failed to notice, she became convinced that I could understand what was being said
 She urged my parents to have me tested by experts in augmentative and alternative communication
 And within a year, I was beginning to use a computer program to communicate
 It was exhilarating, but frustrating at times
 I had so many words in my mind, that I couldn't wait to be able to share them
 Sometimes, I would say things to myself simply because I could
 In myself, I had a ready audience, and I believed that by expressing my thoughts and wishes, others would listen, too
 I was thrust into a world I didn't quite know how to function in
 I stopped going to the care home and managed to get my first job making photocopies
 As simple as this may sound, it was amazing
 My new world was really exciting but often quite overwhelming and frightening
 I was like a man-child, and as liberating as it often was, I struggled
 I also learned that many of those who had known me for a long time found it impossible to abandon the idea of Martin they had in their heads
 While those I had only just met struggled to look past the image of a silent man in a wheelchair
 I realized that some people would only listen to me if what I said was in line with what they expected
 Otherwise, it was disregarded and they did what they felt was best
I discovered that true communication is about more than merely physically conveying a message
 It is about getting the message heard and respected
 Still, things were going well
 I had a job in computing that I loved, and had even got Kojak, the dog I had been dreaming about for years
However, I longed to share my life with someone
 Just as I had resigned myself to being single for the rest of my life, I met Joan
 Not only is she the best thing that has ever happened to me, but Joan helped me to challenge my own misconceptions about myself
 Joan said it was through my words that she fell in love with me
 The first time someone referred to me as a man, it stopped me in my tracks
 I felt like looking around and asking, "Who, me?" That all changed with Joan
 We have an amazing connection and I learned how important it is to communicate openly and honestly
 I felt safe, and it gave me the confidence to truly say what I thought
 I started to feel whole again, a man worthy of love
I began to reshape my destiny
 I spoke up a little more at work
 I asserted my need for independence to the people around me
 Being given a means of communication changed everything
 I used the power of words and will to challenge the preconceptions of those around me and those I had of myself
Communication is what makes us human, enabling us to connect on the deepest level with those around us -- telling our own stories, expressing wants, needs and desires, or hearing those of others by really listening
 So who are we without it?
True communication increases understanding and creates a more caring and compassionate world
 Once, I was perceived to be an inanimate object, a mindless phantom of a boy in a wheelchair
 Today, I am so much more
 A husband, a son, a friend, a brother, a business owner, a first-class honors graduate, a keen amateur photographer
We are told that actions speak louder than words
 But I wonder, do they? Our words, however we communicate them, are just as powerful
 Whether we speak the words with our own voices, type them with our eyes, or communicate them non-verbally to someone who speaks them for us, words are among our most powerful tools
I have come to you through a terrible darkness, pulled from it by caring souls and by language itself
 We are shining here together
 If there is one most difficult obstacle to my way of communicating, it is that sometimes I want to shout and other times simply to whisper a word of love or gratitude
 It all sounds the same
So I've had the great privilege of traveling to some incredible places, photographing these distant landscapes and remote cultures all over the world
 I love my job
But people think it's this string of epiphanies and sunrises and rainbows, when in reality, it looks more something like this
This is my office
We can't afford the fanciest places to stay at night, so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors
 As long as we can stay dry, that's a bonus
 We also can't afford the fanciest restaurants
 So we tend to eat whatever's on the local menu
 And if you're in the Ecuadorian Páramo, you're going to eat a large rodent called a cuy
But what makes our experiences perhaps a little bit different and a little more unique than that of the average person is that we have this gnawing thing in the back of our mind that even in our darkest moments, and those times of despair, we think, "Hey, there might be an image to be made here, there might be a story to be told
"
And why is storytelling important? Well, it helps us to connect with our cultural and our natural heritage
 We're visual creatures, so we use what we see to teach us what we know
 And I fell in love with adventure and discovery, going to explore all these different places that were just minutes from my front doorstep
 There are a lot of beautiful places to find
 Despite all these years that have passed, I still see the world through the eyes of a child and I try to incorporate that sense of wonderment and that sense of curiosity into my photography as often as I can
And we're pretty lucky because here in the South, we're still blessed with a relatively blank canvas that we can fill with the most fanciful adventures and incredible experiences
 It's just a matter of how far our imagination will take us
 See, a lot of people look at this and they say, "Oh yeah, wow, that's a pretty tree
" But I don't just see a tree -- I look at this and I see opportunity
 I see an entire weekend
 Because when I was a kid, these were the types of images that got me off the sofa and dared me to explore, dared me to go find the woods and put my head underwater and see what we have
And folks, I've been photographing all over the world and I promise you, what we have here in the South, what we have in the Sunshine State, rivals anything else that I've seen
 But yet our tourism industry is busy promoting all the wrong things
 Before most kids are 12, they'll have been to Disney World more times than they've been in a canoe or camping under a starry sky
 And I have nothing against Disney or Mickey; I used to go there, too
 But they're missing out on those fundamental connections that create a real sense of pride and ownership for the place that they call home
And this is compounded by the issue that the landscapes that define our natural heritage and fuel our aquifer for our drinking water have been deemed as scary and dangerous and spooky
 When our ancestors first came here, they warned, "Stay out of these areas, they're haunted
 They're full of evil spirits and ghosts
" I don't know where they came up with that idea
 But it's actually led to a very real disconnect, a very real negative mentality that has kept the public disinterested, silent, and ultimately, our environment at risk
 We're a state that's surrounded and defined by water, and yet for centuries, swamps and wetlands have been regarded as these obstacles to overcome
 And so we've treated them as these second-class ecosystems, because they have very little monetary value and of course, they're known to harbor alligators and snakes -- which, I'll admit, these aren't the most cuddly of ambassadors
 And in fact, draining a swamp to make way for agriculture and development was considered the very essence of conservation not too long ago
 Take this bird, for example: this is the prothonotary warbler
 I love this bird because it's a swamp bird, through and through, a swamp bird
 They nest and they mate and they breed in these old-growth swamps in these flooded forests
 And so after the spring, after they raise their young, they then fly thousand of miles over the Gulf of Mexico into Central and South America
 And then after the winter, the spring rolls around and they come back
 They fly thousands of miles over the Gulf of Mexico
 And where do they go? Where do they land? Right back in the same tree
 This is a bird the size of a tennis ball -- I mean, that's crazy! I used a GPS to get here today, and this is my hometown
It's crazy
 So what happens, then, when this bird flies over the Gulf of Mexico into Central America for the winter and then the spring rolls around and it flies back, and it comes back to this: a freshly sodded golf course?
 So you can imagine all else we have to learn about these landscapes if we just preserve them first
 Now despite all this rich life that abounds in these swamps, they still have a bad name
Many people feel uncomfortable with the idea of wading into Florida's blackwater
 I can understand that
 But what I loved about growing up in the Sunshine State is that for so many of us, we live with this latent but very palpable fear that when we put our toes into the water, there might be something much more ancient and much more adapted than we are
 Knowing that you're not top dog is a welcomed discomfort, I think
 How often in this modern and urban and digital age do you actually get the chance to feel vulnerable, or consider that the world may not have been made for just us?
So for the last decade, I began seeking out these areas where the concrete yields to forest and the pines turn to cypress, and I viewed all these mosquitoes and reptiles, all these discomforts, as affirmations that I'd found true wilderness, and I embrace them wholly
 Now as a conservation photographer obsessed with blackwater, it's only fitting that I'd eventually end up in the most famous swamp of all: the Everglades
 I started what turned into a five-year project to hopefully reintroduce the Everglades in a new light, in a more inspired light
 But I knew this would be a tall order, because here you have an area that's roughly a third the size the state of Florida, it's huge
So sure, the national park is the southern end of this system, but all the things that make it unique are these inputs that come in, the fresh water that starts 100 miles north
 So no manner of these political or invisible boundaries protect the park from polluted water or insufficient water
 And unfortunately, that's precisely what we've done
 Over the last 60 years, we have drained, we have dammed, we have dredged the Everglades to where now only one third of the water that used to reach the bay now reaches the bay today
 So this story is not all sunshine and rainbows, unfortunately
 For better or for worse, the story of the Everglades is intrinsically tied to the peaks and the valleys of mankind's relationship with the natural world
 And while I have your attention, I can tell you the real story
 It's that we're taking this, and we're trading it for this, at an alarming rate
 And what's lost on so many people is the sheer scale of which we're discussing
 Because the Everglades is not just responsible for the drinking water for 7 million Floridians; today it also provides the agricultural fields for the year-round tomatoes and oranges for over 300 million Americans
 And it's that same seasonal pulse of water in the summer that built the river of grass 6,000 years ago
 Ironically, today, it's also responsible for the over half a million acres of the endless river of sugarcane
 These are the same fields that are responsible for dumping exceedingly high levels of fertilizers into the watershed, forever changing the system
But in order for you to not just understand how this system works, but to also get personally connected to it, I decided to break the story down into several different narratives
 And I wanted that story to start in Lake Okeechobee, the beating heart of the Everglade system
 And to do that, I picked an ambassador, an iconic species
 It's a great bird, and they used to nest in the thousands, thousands in the northern Everglades
 And why is that? Well, it's because they eat one source of food, an apple snail, about the size of a ping-pong ball, an aquatic gastropod
 And thus, the population of the kites declined
 And so, I wanted a photo that would not only communicate this relationship between wetland, snail and bird, but I also wanted a photo that would communicate how incredible this relationship was, and how very important it is that they've come to depend on each other, this healthy wetland and this bird
 And to do that, I brainstormed this idea
 I started sketching out these plans to make a photo, and I sent it to the wildlife biologist down in Okeechobee -- this is an endangered bird, so it takes special permission to do
 So I built this submerged platform that would hold snails just right under the water
 And I took this platform down to Lake Okeechobee and I spent over a week in the water, wading waist-deep, 9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk, to get one image that I thought might communicate this
 And here's the day that it finally worked:
 And I see him scanning and searching
 And he gets right over the trap, and I see that he's seen it
 And he beelines, he goes straight for the trap
 And in that moment, all those months of planning, waiting, all the sunburn, mosquito bites -- suddenly, they're all worth it
  Oh my gosh, I can't believe it!]
You can believe how excited I was when that happened
 But what the idea was, is that for someone who's never seen this bird and has no reason to care about it, these photos, these new perspectives, will help shed a little new light on just one species that makes this watershed so incredible, so valuable, so important
 Now, I know I can't come here to Gainesville and talk to you about animals in the Everglades without talking about gators
 I love gators, I grew up loving gators
 My parents always said I had an unhealthy relationship with gators
 But what I like about them is, they're like the freshwater equivalent of sharks
 They're feared, they're hated, and they are tragically misunderstood
 Because these are a unique species, they're not just apex predators
 In the Everglades, they are the very architects of the Everglades, because as the water drops down in the winter during the dry season, they start excavating these holes called gator holes
 And they do this because as the water drops down, they'll be able to stay wet and they'll be able to forage
 And now this isn't just affecting them, other animals also depend on this relationship, so they become a keystone species as well
 So how do you make an apex predator, an ancient reptile, at once look like it dominates the system, but at the same time, look vulnerable? Well, you wade into a pit of about 120 of them, then you hope that you've made the right decision
I still have all my fingers, it's cool
But I understand, I know I'm not going to rally you guys, I'm not going to rally the troops to "Save the Everglades for the gators!" It won't happen because they're so ubiquitous, we see them now, they're one of the great conservation success stories of the US
 But there is one species in the Everglades that no matter who you are, you can't help but love, too, and that's the roseate spoonbill
 These birds are great, but they've had a really tough time in the Everglades, because they started out with thousands of nesting pairs in Florida Bay, and at the turn of the 20th century, they got down to two -- two nesting pairs
 And why? That's because women thought they looked better on their hats then they did flying in the sky
 And as their numbers started rebounding, scientists began to pay attention, they started studying these birds
And what they found out is that these birds' behavior is intrinsically tied to the annual draw-down cycle of water in the Everglades, the thing that defines the Everglades watershed
 And so they wait for these concentrated pools of fish to be able to feed enough to feed their young
 So these birds became the very icon of the Everglades -- an indicator species of the overall health of the system
 And just as their numbers were rebounding in the mid-20th century -- shooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 -- just as that started happening, we started draining the southern Everglades
 And we stopped two-thirds of that water from moving south
 And it had drastic consequences
 And just as those numbers started reaching their peak, unfortunately, today, the real spoonbill story, the real photo of what it looks like is more something like this
 So all these different organizations are shouting, they're screaming, "The Everglades is fragile! It's fragile!" It is not
 Because despite all we've taken, despite all we've done and we've drained and we've dammed and we've dredged it, pieces of it are still here, waiting to be put back together
And this is what I've loved about South Florida, that in one place, you have this unstoppable force of mankind meeting the immovable object of tropical nature
 And it's at this new frontier that we are forced with a new appraisal
 What is wilderness worth? What is the value of biodiversity, or our drinking water? And fortunately, after decades of debate, we're finally starting to act on those questions
 We're slowly undertaking these projects to bring more freshwater back to the bay
 But it's up to us as citizens, as residents, as stewards to hold our elected officials to their promises
What can you do to help? It's so easy
 Just get outside, get out there
 Take your friends out, take your kids out, take your family out
 Hire a fishing guide
 It's a lot of fun, just do it -- put your feet in the water
 The swamp will change you, I promise
Over the years, we've been so generous with these other landscapes around the country, cloaking them with this American pride, places that we now consider to define us: Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone
 And sadly, the Everglades is very commonly left out of that conversation
 But I believe it's every bit as iconic and emblematic of who we are as a country as any of these other wildernesses
 It's just a different kind of wild
 It's a wetland of international importance
 And we've come a long way in the last 60 years
 And as the world's largest and most ambitious wetland restoration project, the international spotlight is on us in the Sunshine State
 Because if we can heal this system, it's going to become an icon for wetland restoration all over the world
 But it's up to us to decide which legacy we want to attach our flag to
They say that the Everglades is our greatest test
 If we pass it, we get to keep the planet
 I love that quote, because it's a challenge, it's a prod
 Can we do it? Will we do it? We have to, we must
 But the Everglades is not just a test
 It's also a gift, and ultimately, our responsibility
Thank you
Last year, I went on my first book tour
 In 13 months, I flew to 14 countries and gave some hundred talks
 Every talk in every country began with an introduction, and every introduction began, alas, with a lie: "Taiye Selasi comes from Ghana and Nigeria," or "Taiye Selasi comes from England and the States
" Yes, I was born in England and grew up in the United States
 My mum, born in England, and raised in Nigeria, currently lives in Ghana
 My father was born in Gold Coast, a British colony, raised in Ghana, and has lived for over 30 years in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
 For this reason, my introducers also called me "multinational
" "But Nike is multinational," I thought, "I'm a human being
"
Then, one fine day, mid-tour, I went to Louisiana, a museum in Denmark where I shared the stage with the writer Colum McCann
 We were discussing the role of locality in writing, when suddenly it hit me
 I'm not multinational
 I'm not a national at all
 How could I come from a nation? How can a human being come from a concept? It's a question that had been bothering me for going on two decades
 From newspapers, textbooks, conversations, I had learned to speak of countries as if they were eternal, singular, naturally occurring things, but I wondered: to say that I came from a country suggested that the country was an absolute, some fixed point in place in time, a constant thing, but was it? In my lifetime, countries had disappeared -- Czechoslovakia; appeared -- Timor-Leste; failed -- Somalia
 To me, a country -- this thing that could be born, die, expand, contract -- hardly seemed the basis for understanding a human being
And so it came as a huge relief to discover the sovereign state
 What we call countries are actually various expressions of sovereign statehood, an idea that came into fashion only 400 years ago
 When I learned this, beginning my masters degree in international relations, I felt a sort of surge of relief
 It was as I had suspected
 For the next 10 years, I sought to re- or un-define myself, my world, my work, my experience, beyond the logic of the state
In 2005, I wrote an essay, "What is an Afropolitan," sketching out an identity that privileged culture over country
 It was thrilling how many people could relate to my experience, and instructional how many others didn't buy my sense of self
 "How can Selasi claim to come from Ghana," one such critic asked, "when she's never known the indignities of traveling abroad on a Ghanian passport?"
 I've got a friend named Layla who was born and raised in Ghana
 Her parents are third-generation Ghanians of Lebanese descent
 Layla, who speaks fluent Twi, knows Accra like the back of her hand, but when we first met years ago, I thought, "She's not from Ghana
" In my mind, she came from Lebanon, despite the patent fact that all her formative experience took place in suburban Accra
 I, like my critics, was imagining some Ghana where all Ghanaians had brown skin or none held U
K
 passports
 I'd fallen into the limiting trap that the language of coming from countries sets -- the privileging of a fiction, the singular country, over reality: human experience
 "All experience is local," he said
 "All identity is experience," I thought
 I'm multi-local
"
See, "Taiye Selasi comes from the United States," isn't the truth
 I have no relationship with the United States, all 50 of them, not really
 My relationship is with Brookline, the town where I grew up; with New York City, where I started work; with Lawrenceville, where I spend Thanksgiving
 What makes America home for me is not my passport or accent, but these very particular experiences and the places they occur
 My relationship is with Accra, where my mother lives, where I go each year, with the little garden in Dzorwulu where my father and I talk for hours
 My experience is where I'm from
 Our experience is where we're from
So, where are you a local? I propose a three-step test
First, think of your daily rituals, whatever they may be: making your coffee, driving to work, harvesting your crops, saying your prayers
 What kind of rituals are these? Where do they occur? In what city or cities in the world do shopkeepers know your face? As a child, I carried out fairly standard suburban rituals in Boston, with adjustments made for the rituals my mother brought from London and Lagos
 We took off our shoes in the house, we were unfailingly polite with our elders, we ate slow-cooked, spicy food
 In snowy North America, ours were rituals of the global South
 The first time I went to Delhi or to southern parts of Italy, I was shocked by how at home I felt
 The rituals were familiar
Now, think of your relationships, of the people who shape your days
 To whom do you speak at least once a week, be it face to face or on FaceTime? Be reasonable in your assessment; I'm not talking about your Facebook friends
 I'm speaking of the people who shape your weekly emotional experience
 "R" number two, relationships
 By restrictions, I mean, where are you able to live? What passport do you hold? Are you restricted by, say, racism, from feeling fully at home where you live? By civil war, dysfunctional governance, economic inflation, from living in the locality where you had your rituals as a child? This is the least sexy of the R’s, less lyric than rituals and relationships, but the question takes us past "Where are you now?" to "Why aren't you there, and why?" Rituals, relationships, restrictions
Take a piece of paper and put those three words on top of three columns, then try to fill those columns as honestly as you can
So let's try it
 I have a friend named Olu
 He's 35 years old
 His parents, born in Nigeria, came to Germany on scholarships
 Olu was born in Nuremberg and lived there until age 10
 When his family moved to Lagos, he studied in London, then came to Berlin
 He loves going to Nigeria -- the weather, the food, the friends -- but hates the political corruption there
 Where is Olu from?
I have another friend named Udo
 He's also 35 years old
 Udo was born in Córdoba, in northwest Argentina, where his grandparents migrated from Germany, what is now Poland, after the war
 Where is Udo from? With his blonde hair and blue eyes, Udo could pass for German, but holds an Argentinian passport, so needs a visa to live in Berlin
 That Udo is from Argentina has largely to do with history
 That he's a local of Buenos Aires and Berlin, that has to do with life
Olu, who looks Nigerian, needs a visa to visit Nigeria
 He speaks Yoruba with an English accent, and English with a German one
 To claim that he's "not really Nigerian," though, denies his experience in Lagos, the rituals he practiced growing up, his relationship with family and friends
Meanwhile, though Lagos is undoubtedly one of his homes, Olu always feels restricted there, not least by the fact that he's gay
Both he and Udo are restricted by the political conditions of their parents' countries, from living where some of their most meaningful rituals and relationships occur
 To say Olu is from Nigeria and Udo is from Argentina distracts from their common experience
 Their rituals, their relationships, and their restrictions are the same
 It's quicker to say "Nigeria" than "Lagos and Berlin," and as with Google Maps, we can always zoom in closer, from country to city to neighborhood
 But that's not quite the point
 The difference between "Where are you from?" and "Where are you a local?" isn't the specificity of the answer; it's the intention of the question
 Replacing the language of nationality with the language of locality asks us to shift our focus to where real life occurs
 Even that most glorious expression of countryhood, the World Cup, gives us national teams comprised mostly of multilocal players
 As a unit of measurement for human experience, the country doesn't quite work
 That's why Olu says, "I'm German, but my parents come from Nigeria
" The "but" in that sentence belies the inflexibility of the units, one fixed and fictional entity bumping up against another
 "I'm a local of Lagos and Berlin," suggests overlapping experiences, layers that merge together, that can't be denied or removed
 You can take away my passport, but you can't take away my experience
 That I carry within me
 Where I'm from comes wherever I go
To be clear, I'm not suggesting that we do away with countries
 There's much to be said for national history, more for the sovereign state
 Culture exists in community, and community exists in context
 What I'm questioning is primacy
 All of those introductions on tour began with reference to nation, as if knowing what country I came from would tell my audience who I was
 What are we really seeking, though, when we ask where someone comes from? And what are we really seeing when we hear an answer?
Here's one possibility: basically, countries represent power
 "Where are you from?" Mexico
 Poland
 Bangladesh
 Less power
 America
 Germany
 Japan
 China
 Russia
 Ambiguous
It's possible that without realizing it, we're playing a power game, especially in the context of multi-ethnic countries
 As any recent immigrant knows, the question "Where are you from?" or "Where are you really from?" is often code for "Why are you here?"
Then we have the scholar William Deresiewicz's writing of elite American colleges
 "Students think that their environment is diverse if one comes from Missouri and another from Pakistan -- never mind that all of their parents are doctors or bankers
"
I'm with him
 To call one student American, another Pakistani, then triumphantly claim student body diversity ignores the fact that these students are locals of the same milieu
 The same holds true on the other end of the economic spectrum
 A Mexican gardener in Los Angeles and a Nepali housekeeper in Delhi have more in common in terms of rituals and restrictions than nationality implies
 I'm often asked if I plan to "go back" to Ghana
 I go to Accra every year, but I can't "go back" to Ghana
 It's not because I wasn't born there
 My father can't go back, either
 The country in which he was born, that country no longer exists
 We can never go back to a place and find it exactly where we left it
 Something, somewhere will always have changed, most of all, ourselves
 People
Finally, what we're talking about is human experience, this notoriously and gloriously disorderly affair
 The more we know about where a story is set, the more local color and texture, the more human the characters start to feel, the more relatable, not less
 To begin our conversations with an acknowledgement of this complexity brings us closer together, I think, not further apart
 She isn't a citizen of the world, but a citizen of worlds
 She is a local of New York, Rome and Accra
"
Thank you
 Her doctor was called Alois
 Alois didn't know how to help Auguste, but he watched over her until, sadly, she passed away in 1906
 After she died, Alois performed an autopsy and found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain -- the likes of which he'd never seen before
Now here's the even more striking thing
 If Auguste had instead been alive today, we could offer her no more help than Alois was able to 114 years ago
 Alois was Dr
 And Auguste Deter was the first patient to be diagnosed with what we now call Alzheimer's disease
 Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly
 But we've made essentially no progress at all in treating Alzheimer's disease
 Alzheimer's now affects 40 million people worldwide
 But by 2050, it will affect 150 million people -- which, by the way, will include many of you
 If you're hoping to live to be 85 or older, your chance of getting Alzheimer's will be almost one in two
 In other words, odds are you'll spend your golden years either suffering from Alzheimer's or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer's
 Already in the United States alone, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year
 One out of every five Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's
 It is today the most expensive disease, and costs are projected to increase fivefold by 2050, as the baby boomer generation ages
It may surprise you that, put simply, Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation
 But we've done relatively little to address it
 Today, of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down
 We understand less about the science of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money into researching it
The lack of resources stems from a more fundamental cause: a lack of awareness
 Because here's what few people know but everyone should: Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it
 For most of the past 114 years, everyone, including scientists, mistakenly confused Alzheimer's with aging
 We thought that becoming senile was a normal and inevitable part of getting old
 But we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease
 As well as triggering severe loss of memory and mental abilities, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly reduces life expectancy and is always fatal
Remember Dr
 Alzheimer found strange plaques and tangles in Auguste's brain a century ago
 For almost a century, we didn't know much about these
 Today we know they're made from protein molecules
 You can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally folds into an elaborate piece of origami
 But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky bits are on the outside
 This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other, forming clumps that eventually become large plaques and tangles
 That's what we see in the brains of Alzheimer's patients
We've spent the past 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this malfunction works
 There are many steps, and identifying which step to try to block is complex -- like defusing a bomb
 We have to find the right step to block, and then create a drug that does it
Until recently, we for the most part have been cutting wires and hoping for the best
 But now we've got together a diverse group of people -- medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists, physicists, engineers and mathematicians
 No one outside of our lab has seen these yet
 Let's look at some videos of what happened when we tested these new drugs in worms
 And you can see they're clearly sick
 But if we give our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that they're healthy, and they live a normal lifespan
 This is just an initial positive result, but research like this shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and we can cure
After 114 years of waiting, there's finally real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years
 But to grow that hope, to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help
 This isn't about scientists like me -- it's about you
 We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we try, we can beat it
 In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments, the pharmaceutical industry, scientists and regulators
 That was essential for advancing treatment for HIV in the late 1980s
 Today, we see that same drive to beat cancer
 And their families, the hidden victims, caring for their loved ones night and day, are often too worn out to go out and advocate for change
 So, it really is down to you
 Everyone with a brain is at risk
 Today, there are 40 million patients like Auguste, who can't create the change they need for themselves
 Help speak up for them, and help demand a cure
When I was only three or four, I fell in love with poetry, with the rhythms and the music of language; with the power of metaphor and of imagery, poetry being the essence of communication -- the discipline, the distillation
 And all these years later, the poems I'll read today are from my just-finished seventh book of poetry
Well, five years ago, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease
 But you can imagine that I was appalled to learn that women are largely left out of research trials, despite gender-specific medical findings having demonstrated that we are not actually just small men --
who happen to have different reproductive systems
 Gender-specific medicine is good for men, too
But you bring to a crisis the person you already are, including the, yes, momentum that you've learned to invoke through passionate caring and through action, both of which require but also create energy
 So as an activist, I began working with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation -- that's pdf
org -- to create a major initiative to put women on the Parkinson's disease map
 And as a poet, I began working with this subject matter, finding it tragic, hilarious, sometimes even joyful
 I do not feel diminished by Parkinson's; I feel distilled by it, and I actually very much like the woman I'm distilling into
"No Signs of Struggle"
Growing small requires enormity of will: just sitting still in the doctor's waiting room watching the future shuffle in and out, watching it stoop; stare at you while you try not to look
You are the new kid on the block
 You are still learning that growing small requires a largeness of spirit you can't fit into yet: acceptance of irritating help from those who love you; giving way and over, but not up
You've swallowed hard the contents of the "Drink Me" bottle, and felt yourself shrink
 Now, familiar furniture looms, floors tilt, and doorknobs yield only when wrestled round with both hands
 It demands colossal patience, all this growing small: your diminished sleep at night, your handwriting, your voice, your height
You are more the incredible shrinking woman than the Buddhist mystic, serene, making do with less
 Less is not always more
 Here is a place behind the eyes of those accustomed by what some would call diminishment
It is a place of merciless poetry, a gift of presence previously ignored, drowned in the daily clutter
 Here every gesture needs intention, is alive with consciousness
You can spot it in the provocation of a button, an arm poking at a sleeve, a balancing act at a night-time curb while negotiating the dark
 Feats of such modest valor, who would suspect them to be exercises in an intimate, fierce discipline, a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware?
Such understated power here, in these tottering dancers who exert stupendous effort on tasks most view as insignificant
 Such quiet beauty here, in these, my soft-voiced, stiff-limbed people; such resolve masked by each placid face
Thank you
This one is called "On Donating My Brain to Science
"
Not a problem
 Skip over all the pages reassuring religious people
 Already a universal donor: kidneys, corneas, liver, lungs, tissue, heart, veins, whatever
Odd that the modest brain never imagined its unique value in research, maybe saving someone else from what it is they're not quite sure I have
 Flattering, that
So fill in the forms, drill through the answers, trill out a blithe spirit
And slice me, dice me, spread me on your slides
 Find what I'm trying to tell you
Earn me, learn me, scan me, squint through your lens
 Uncover what I'd hint at if I could
Be my guest, do your best, harvest me, track the clues
 This was a good brain while alive
 This was a brain that paid its dues
I want to be used I want to be used I want to be used up
And this one's called "The Ghost Light
"
Lit from within is the sole secure way to traverse dark matter
 Some life forms -- certain mushrooms, snails, jellyfish, worms -- glow bioluminescent, and people as well; we emit infra-red light from our most lucent selves
 Our tragedy is we can't see it
We see by reflecting
 External illumination can distort, though
 When gravity bends light, huge galaxy clusters can act as telescopes, elongating background images of star systems to faint arcs -- a lensing effect like viewing distant street lamps through a glass of wine
A glass of wine or two now makes me weave as if acting the drunkard's part; as if, besotted with unrequited love for the dynamic Turner canvasses spied out by the Hubble, I could lurch down a city street set without provoking every pedestrian walk-on stare
Stare as long as you need to
 If you think about it, walking, even standing, is illogical -- such tiny things, feet! --
especially when one's body is not al dente anymore
Besides, creature of extremes and excess, I've always thought Apollo beautiful but boring, and a bit of a dumb blonde
 Dionysians don't do balance
Balance, in other words, has never been my strong point
 But I digress
 More and more these days, digression seems the most direct route through from where I've lost or found myself out of place, mind, turn, time
Place your foot just so, mind how you turn: too swift a swivel can bring you down
 Take your time ushering the audience out, saying goodbye to the actors
 The ghost light is what they call the single bulb hanging above the bare stage in an empty theater
In the empty theater of such a night, waking to meet no external radiance, this is the final struggle left to win, this the sole beacon to beckon the darkness in and let the rest begin, this the lens through which at last to see both Self and Other arrayed with the bright stain of original sin: lit from within
And this is the last one
"This Dark Hour"
Late summer, 4 A
M
 The rain slows to a stop, dripping still from the broad leaves of blue hostas unseen in the garden's dark
 Barefoot, careful on the slick slate slabs, I need no light, I know the way, stoop by the mint bed, scoop a fistful of moist earth, then grope for a chair, spread a shawl, and sit, breathing in the wet green August air
This is the small, still hour before the newspaper lands in the vestibule like a grenade, the phone shrills, the computer screen blinks and glares awake
 poem in my head, soil in my hand: unnamable fullness
 This hour, when blood of my blood bone of bone, child grown to manhood now -- stranger, intimate, not distant but apart -- lies safe, off dreaming melodies while love sleeps, safe, in his arms
To have come to this place, lived to this moment: immeasurable lightness
 The density of black starts to blur umber
 Tentative, a cardinal's coloratura, then the mourning dove's elegy
 The city stirs
 Likely, I'll lose my way
 There will be stumbling, falling, cursing the dark
 Whatever comes, there was this hour when nothing mattered, all was unbearably dear
And when I'm done with daylights, should those who loved me grieve too long a while, let them remember that I had this hour -- this dark, perfect hour -- and smile
Thank you
 I grew up in the west of Ireland, wedged between four brothers, two older than me and two younger than me
 So of course I had to be interested in human rights, and equality and justice, and using my elbows!
And those issues stayed with me and guided me, and in particular, when I was elected the first woman President of Ireland, from 1990 to 1997
 I dedicated my presidency to having a space for those who felt marginalized on the island of Ireland, and bringing together communities from Northern Ireland with those from the Republic, trying to build peace
 And I went as the first Irish president to the United Kingdom and met with Queen Elizabeth II, and also welcomed to my official residence -- which we call "Áras an Uachtaráin," the house of the president -- members of the royal family, including, notably, the Prince of Wales
 And I was aware that at the time of my presidency, Ireland was a country beginning a rapid economic progress
 We were a country that was benefiting from the solidarity of the European Union
 Indeed, when Ireland first joined the European Union in 1973, there were parts of the country that were considered developing, including my own beloved native county, County Mayo
 I led trade delegations here to the United States, to Japan, to India, to encourage investment, to help to create jobs, to build up our economy, to build up our health system, our education -- our development
What I didn't have to do as president was buy land on mainland Europe, so that Irish citizens could go there because our island was going underwater
 What I didn't have to think about, either as president or as a constitutional lawyer, was the implications for the sovereignty of the territory because of the impact of climate change
 But that is what President Tong, of the Republic of Kiribati, has to wake up every morning thinking about
 He has bought land in Fiji as an insurance policy, what he calls, "migration with dignity," because he knows that his people may have to leave their islands
 As I listened to President Tong describing the situation, I really felt that this was a problem that no leader should have to face
 And as I heard him speak about the pain of his problems, I thought about Eleanor Roosevelt
 I thought about her and those who worked with her on the Commission on Human Rights, which she chaired in 1948, and drew up the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
 For them, it would have been unimaginable that a whole country could go out of existence because of human-induced climate change
 It was because of the impact on people, and the impact on their rights -- their rights to food and safe water, health, education and shelter
 And I say this with humility, because I came late to the issue of climate change
 When I served as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights from 1997 to 2002, climate change wasn't at the front of my mind
 I don't remember making a single speech on climate change
 I knew that there was another part of the United Nations -- the UN Convention on Climate Change -- that was dealing with the issue of climate change
 It was later when I started to work in African countries on issues of development and human rights
 And I kept hearing this pervasive sentence: "Oh, but things are so much worse now, things are so much worse
I met Constance Okollet, who had formed a women's group in Eastern Uganda, and she told me that when she was growing up, she had a very normal life in her village and they didn't go hungry, they knew that the seasons would come as they were predicted to come, they knew when to sow and they knew when to harvest, and so they had enough food
 The school had been destroyed, livelihoods had been destroyed, their harvest had been destroyed
 She forms this women's group to try to keep her community together
 And this was a reality that really struck me, because of course, Constance Okollet wasn't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions that were causing this problem
 There was an unprecedented flooding in the country, it covered about a third of the country, over 300 people were killed, and hundreds of thousands lost their livelihoods
 And the average person in Malawi emits about 80 kg of CO2 a year
 The average US citizen emits about 17
5 metric tons
 So those who are suffering disproportionately don't drive cars, don't have electricity, don't consume very significantly, and yet they are feeling more and more the impacts of the changes in the climate, the changes that are preventing them from knowing how to grow food properly, and knowing how to look after their future
And I know that we're not able to address some of that injustice because we're not on course for a safe world
 Governments around the world agreed at the conference in Copenhagen, and have repeated it at every conference on climate, that we have to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming above pre-Industrial standards
 But we're on course for about four degrees
 So we face an existential threat to the future of our planet
 And that made me realize that climate change is the greatest threat to human rights in the 21st century
 First of all, to be on the side of those who are suffering most and are most effected
 And secondly, to make sure that they're not left behind again, when we start to move and start to address climate change with climate action, as we are doing
In our very unequal world today, it's very striking how many people are left behind
 In our world of 7
2 billion people, about 3 billion are left behind
 1
3 billion don't have access to electricity, and they light their homes with kerosene and candles, both of which are dangerous
 And in fact they spend a lot of their tiny income on that form of lighting
 2
6 billion people cook on open fires -- on coal, wood and animal dung
 And this causes about 4 million deaths a year from indoor smoke inhalation, and of course, most of those who die are women
 So we have a very unequal world, and we need to change from "business as usual
" And we shouldn't underestimate the scale and the transformative nature of the change which will be needed, because we have to go to zero carbon emissions by about 2050, if we're going to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming
 And that means we have to leave about two-thirds of the known resources of fossil fuels in the ground
It's a very big change, and it means that obviously, industrialized countries must cut their emissions, must become much more energy-efficient, and must move as quickly as possible to renewable energy
 For developing countries and emerging economies, the problem and the challenge is to grow without emissions, because they must develop; they have very poor populations
 Indeed, no country in the world has actually grown without emissions
 All the countries have developed with fossil fuels, and then may be moving to renewable energy
 So it is a very big challenge, and it requires the total support of the international community, with the necessary finance and technology, and systems and support, because no country can make itself safe from the dangers of climate change
 Human solidarity, if you like, based on self-interest -- because we are all in this together, and we have to work together to ensure that we reach zero carbon by 2050
The good news is that change is happening, and it's happening very fast
 Here in California, there's a very ambitious emissions target to cut emissions
 In Hawaii, they're passing legislation to have 100 percent renewable energy by 2045
 And governments are very ambitious around the world
 In Ethiopia, the commitment is to be carbon-neutral by 2027
 Apple have pledged that their factories in China will use renewable energy
 And there is a race on at the moment to convert electricity from tidal and wave power, in order that we can leave the coal in the ground
 And that change is both welcome and is happening very rapidly
 But it's still not enough, and the political will is still not enough
Let me come back to President Tong and his people in Kiribati
 They actually could be able to live on their island and have a solution, but it would take a lot of political will
 President Tong told me about his ambitious idea to either build up or even float the little islands where his people live
 This, of course, is beyond the resources of Kiribati itself
 It would require great solidarity and support from other countries, and it would require the kind of imaginative idea that we bring together when we want to have a space station in the air
 Yes, the challenges of the transformation we need are big, but they can be solved
 We are actually, as a people, very capable of coming together to solve problems
 It was a year when the world faced what must have seemed almost insoluble problems -- the devastation of the world wars, particularly the Second World War; the fragile peace that had been brought about; the need for a whole economic regeneration
 But the leaders of that time didn't flinch from this
 They had the capacity, they had a sense of being driven by never again must the world have this kind of problem
 A Marshall Plan for Europe, a devastated Europe, to reconstruct it
 And indeed a few years later, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
2015 is a year that is similar in its importance to 1945, with similar challenges and similar potential
 There will be two big summits this year: the first one, in September in New York, is the summit for the sustainable development goals
 And then the summit in Paris in December, to give us a climate agreement
 The sustainable development goals are intended to help countries to live sustainably, in tune with Mother Earth, not to take out of Mother Earth and destroy ecosystems, but rather, to live in harmony with Mother Earth, by living under sustainable development
 So we need to take steps that will be monitored and reviewed, so that we can keep increasing the ambition of how we cut emissions, and how we move more rapidly to renewable energy, so that we have a safe world
It's an issue for all of us, and it's an issue where we need more and more momentum
 Indeed, the face of the environmentalist has changed, because of the justice dimension
 It's now an issue for faith-based organizations, under very good leadership from Pope Francis, and indeed, the Church of England, which is divesting from fossil fuels
 It's an issue for the business community, and the good news is that the business community is changing very rapidly -- except for the fossil fuel industries --
Even they are beginning to slightly change their language -- but only slightly
 But business is not only moving rapidly to the benefits of renewable energy, but is urging politicians to give them more signals, so that they can move even more rapidly
 It's an issue for the trade union movement
 It's an issue for the women's movement
 It's an issue for young people
I was very struck when I learned that Jibreel Khazan, one of the Greensboro Four who had taken part in the Woolworth sit-ins, said quite recently that climate change is the lunch counter moment for young people
 So, lunch counter moment for young people of the 21st century -- the sort of real human rights issue of the 21st century, because he said it is the greatest challenge to humanity and justice in our world
I recall very much the Climate March last September, and that was a huge momentum, not just in New York, but all around the world
 and we have to build on that
 I was marching with some of The Elders family, and I saw a placard a little bit away from me, but we were wedged so closely together -- because after all, there were 400,000 people out in the streets of New York -- so I couldn't quite get to that placard, I would have just liked to have been able to step behind it, because it said, "Angry Grannies!"
 We know that inevitably it will be a climate-constrained world, because of the emissions we've already put up there, but it could be a world that is much more equal and much fairer, and much better for health, and better for jobs and better for energy security, than the world we have now, if we have switched sufficiently and early enough to renewable energy, and no one is left behind
 No one is left behind
And just as we've been looking back this year -- in 2015 to 1945, looking back 70 years -- I would like to think that they will look back, that world will look back 35 years from 2050, 35 years to 2015, and that they will say, "Weren't they good to do what they did in 2015? We really appreciate that they took the decisions that made a difference, and that put the world on the right pathway, and we benefit now from that pathway," that they will feel that somehow we took our responsibilities, we did what was done in 1945 in similar terms, we didn't miss the opportunity, we lived up to our responsibilities
 That's what this year is about
And somehow for me, it's captured in words of somebody that I admired very much
 She was a mentor of mine, she was a friend, she died much too young, she was an extraordinary personality, a great champion of the environment: Wangari Maathai
 Wangari said once, "In the course of history, there comes a time when humanity is called upon to shift to a new level of consciousness, to reach a higher moral ground
" And that's what we have to do
 We have to reach a new level of consciousness, a higher moral ground
 And we have to do it this year in those two big summits
 And that won't happen unless we have the momentum from people around the world who say: "We want action now, we want to change course, we want a safe world, a safe world for future generations, a safe world for our children and our grandchildren, and we're all in this together
"
Thank you
 It's a show produced by murderers and shared around the world via the Internet
 Their names have become familiar: James Foley, Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig, Haruna Yukawa, Kenji Goto Jogo
Their beheadings by the Islamic State were barbaric, but if we think they were archaic, from a remote, obscure age, then we're wrong
 They were uniquely modern, because the murderers acted knowing well that millions of people would tune in to watch
The headlines called them savages and barbarians, because the image of one man overpowering another, killing him with a knife to the throat, conforms to our idea of ancient, primitive practices, the polar opposite of our urban, civilized ways
 We don't do things like that
 But that's the irony
 We think a beheading has nothing to do with us, even as we click on the screen to watch
 But it is to do with us
 The Islamic State beheadings are not ancient or remote
 They're a global, 21st century event, a 21st century event that takes place in our living rooms, at our desks, on our computer screens
 They're entirely dependent on the power of technology to connect us
 And whether we like it or not, everyone who watches is a part of the show
And lots of people watch
 We don't know exactly how many
 Obviously, it's difficult to calculate
 But a poll taken in the UK, for example, in August 2014, estimated that 1
2 million people had watched the beheading of James Foley in the few days after it was released
 And that's just the first few days, and just Britain
 Nine percent may be a small minority of all the people who could watch, but it's still a very large crowd
 And of course that crowd is growing all the time, because every week, every month, more people will keep downloading and keep watching
If we go back 11 years, before sites like YouTube and Facebook were born, it was a similar story
Nick Berg's beheading quickly became one of the most searched for items on the Internet
 Within a day, it was the top search term across search engines like Google, Lycos, Yahoo
 In the week after Nick Berg's beheading, these were the top 10 search terms in the United States
 One Dutch website owner said that his daily viewing figures rose from 300,000 to 750,000 every time a beheading in Iraq was shown
 He told reporters 18 months later that it had been downloaded many millions of times, and that's just one website
 A similar pattern was seen again and again when videos of beheadings were released during the Iraq War
Social media sites have made these images more accessible than ever before, but if we take another step back in history, we'll see that it was the camera that first created a new kind of crowd in our history of beheadings as public spectacle
 As soon as the camera appeared on the scene, a full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939, it had an immediate and unequivocal effect
 It was the execution, the guillotining, of a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann, outside the prison Saint-Pierre in Versailles
 Weidmann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn, as was customary at the time, but his executioner was new to the job, and he'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare
 So Weidmann was executed at 4:30 in the morning, by which time on a June morning, there was enough light to take photographs, and a spectator in the crowd filmed the event, unbeknownst to the authorities
 The crowd on the day of Weidmann's execution was called "unruly" and "disgusting" by the press, but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people who could now study the action over and over again, freeze-framed in every detail
The camera may have made these scenes more accessible than ever before, but it's not just about the camera
 There could be 40,000 or 50,000 to see a famous criminal killed
 And a beheading, which was a rare event in England at the time, attracted even more
In May 1820, five men known as the Cato Street Conspirators were executed in London for plotting to assassinate members of the British government
 They were hung and then decapitated
 It was a gruesome scene
 Each man's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd
 And 100,000 people, that's 10,000 more than can fit into Wembley Stadium, had turned out to watch
 The streets were packed
 People had rented out windows and rooftops
 People had climbed onto carts and wagons in the street
 People climbed lamp posts
 People had been known to have died in the crush on popular execution days
Evidence suggests that throughout our history of public beheadings and public executions, the vast majority of the people who come to see are either enthusiastic or, at best, unmoved
 Disgust has been comparatively rare, and even when people are disgusted and are horrified, it doesn't always stop them from coming out all the same to watch
Perhaps the most striking example of the human ability to watch a beheading and remain unmoved and even be disappointed was the introduction in France in 1792 of the guillotine, that famous decapitation machine
 To us in the 21st century, the guillotine may seem like a monstrous contraption, but to the first crowds who saw it, it was actually a disappointment
 They were used to seeing long, drawn-out, torturous executions on the scaffold, where people were mutilated and burned and pulled apart slowly
 To them, watching the guillotine in action, it was so quick, there was nothing to see
"
The end of torturous public judicial executions in Europe and America was partly to do with being more humane towards the criminal, but it was also partly because the crowd obstinately refused to behave in the way that they should
 All too often, execution day was more like a carnival than a solemn ceremony
Take, for example, the incidents of suicide baiting
 This is when a crowd gathers to watch a person who has climbed to the top of a public building in order to kill themselves, and people in the crowd shout and jeer, "Get on with it! Go on and jump!" This is a well-recognized phenomenon
 One paper in 1981 found that in 10 out of 21 threatened suicide attempts, there was incidents of suicide baiting and jeering from a crowd
 And there have been incidents reported in the press this year
 This was a very widely reported incident in Telford and Shropshire in March this year
And when it happens today, people take photographs and they take videos on their phones and they post those videos online
 When it comes to brutal murderers who post their beheading videos, the Internet has created a new kind of crowd
 It's nothing to do with me
 It's already happened
 We are also offered an unprecedented sense of intimacy
 We can all watch in private, in our own time and space, and no one need ever know that we've clicked on the screen to watch
This sense of separation -- from other people, from the event itself -- seems to be key to understanding our ability to watch, and there are several ways in which the Internet creates a sense of detachment that seems to erode individual moral responsibility
 We feel less accountable for our actions when we interact online
 There's a sense of anonymity, a sense of invisibility, so we feel less accountable for our behavior
 The Internet also makes it far easier to stumble upon things inadvertently, things that we would usually avoid in everyday life
 Today, a video can start playing before you even know what you're watching
 Or you may be tempted to look at material that you wouldn't look at in everyday life or you wouldn't look at if you were with other people at the time
 And when the action is pre-recorded and takes place in a distant time and space, watching seems like a passive activity
 There's nothing I can do about it now
 It's already happened
But we're not passive when we watch
 On the contrary, we're fulfilling the murderer's desire to be seen
 When the victim of a decapitation is bound and defenseless, he or she essentially becomes a pawn in their killer's show
 Unlike a trophy head that's taken in battle, that represents the luck and skill it takes to win a fight, when a beheading is staged, when it's essentially a piece of theater, the power comes from the reception the killer receives as he performs
 In other words, watching is very much part of the event
 The event no longer takes place in a single location at a certain point in time as it used to and as it may still appear to
 Now the event is stretched out in time and place, and everyone who watches plays their part
We should stop watching, but we know we won't
Thank you
 Let me get this back
 Thank you
 Let's move here
 While they install for the next performance, I want to ask you the question that probably many here have, which is how did you get interested in this topic?
 So I wanted to kind of twist it round and say, "Let's look at us
" We're looking through the glass case at these shrunken heads
 Let's look at our own history and our own cultural fascination with these things
 BG: Thank you for sharing that
 Thank you
 In the Name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful
 I was born in a middle class family
 My father was five years old when he lost his father, but by the time I was born, he was already a businessman
 But it didn't make a difference to him if his children were going to be a boy or a girl: they were going to go to school
 So I guess I was the lucky one
 You can imagine as a child what I went through
 Day to day, I watched women being carried to a graveyard, or watched children going to a graveyard
 At that time, when I finished my high school, I really wanted to be a doctor
 I wanted to be a doctor to help women and children
 So I completed my education, but I wanted to go to university
 Unfortunately, in my country, there wasn't a dormitory for girls, so I was accepted in medical school, but I could not go there
 So as a result, my father sent me to America
I came to America
 I completed my education
 While I was completing my education, my country was invaded by Russia
 And do you know that at the time I was completing my education, I didn't know what was going on with my family or with my country
 There were months, years, I didn't know about it
 My family was in a refugee camp
 So as soon as I completed my education, I brought my family to America
 I wanted them to be safe
But where was my heart? My heart was in Afghanistan
 Day after day, when I listened to the news, when I followed what was going on with my country, my heart was breaking up
 I really wanted to go back to my country, but at the same time I knew I could not go there, because there was no place for me
 I had a good job
 I was a professor at a university
 I earned good money
 I had a good life
 My family was here
 But I wasn't happy
 So I went to the refugee camp
 And when I went to the refugee camp in Pakistan, there were 7
5 million refugees
 About 90 percent of them were women and children
 Most of the men have been killed or they were in war
 And you know, in the refugee camp, when I went day-to-day to do a survey, I found things you never could imagine
 I saw a young woman have no way to go anywhere, no education, no entertainment, no place to even live
 I saw young men that had lost their father and their home, and they are supporting the family as a 10-to-12-year old boy -- being the head of the household, trying to protect their sister and their mother and their children
 My heart was beating for my people, and I didn't know what to do
 At that moment, we talk about momentum
 At that moment, I felt, what can I do for these people? How could I help these people? I am one individual
 What can I do for them?
But at that moment, I knew that education changed my life
 It transformed me
 It gave me status
 It gave me confidence
 It gave me a career
 It helped me to support my family, to bring my family to another country, to be safe
 And I knew that at that moment that what I should give to my people is education and health, and that's what I went after
 And also, by Russia invading Afghanistan, people were not trusting anyone
 It was very hard to come and say, "I want to do this
" Who am I? Somebody who comes from the United States
 Somebody who got educated here
So I really needed to build the trust in this community
 I asked
 Finally, I found one man
 He was 80 years old
 He was a mullah
 I went to his tent in the camp, and I asked him, "I want to make you a teacher
" Finally, he accepted my offer, and once I started a class in his compound, the word spread all over
 In a matter of one year, we had 25 schools set up, 15,000 children going to school, and it was amazing
Thank you
 Thank you
 We were training women's rights, human rights, democracy, rule of law
 We were giving all kinds of training
 All of a sudden, I saw my staff running to rooms and locking the doors and telling me, "Run away, hide!" And you know, as a leader, what do you do? You're scared
 You know it's dangerous
 You know your life is on the line
 But as a leader, you have to hold it together
 You have to hold it together and show strength
 So I said, "What's going on?" And these people were pouring into my office
 So I invited them to the office
 They came, and there were nine of them -- nine Taliban
 They were the ugliest looking men you can ever see
Very mean-looking people, black clothes, black turban, and they pour into my office
 And I invited them to have a seat and have tea
 They said no
 And of course, with the tone of voice they were using, it was very scary, but I was really shaking up
 But also I was strong, holding myself up
 And, of course, by that time, you know how I dress -- I dress from head to toe in a black hijab
 The only thing you could see, my eyes
 They asked me, "What are you doing? Don't you know that school is banned for girls? What are you doing here?" And you know, I just looked at them, and I said, "What school? Where is the school?"
And they look at my face, and they said, "You are teaching girls here
" I said, "This is a house of somebody
 We have some students coming, and they are all learning Koran, Holy Book
 And you know, Koran says that if you learn the Holy Book, the woman, they can be a good wife, and they can obey their husband
And I tell you one thing: that's the way you work with those people, and you know --
So by that time, they started speaking Pashto
 They talked to each other, and they said, "Let's go, leave her alone, she's OK
" And you know, this time, I offered them tea again, and they took a sip and they laughed
 They didn't know why they didn't kill me
 They didn't know why they didn't take me away
 But everybody was happy to see me
 Very happy, and I was happy to be alive, of course
Of course, I was happy to be alive
 But also, as we continuously gave training during the fall of the Taliban -- of course during the Taliban there is another story
 We went underground and we provided education for 80 schoolgirls, 3,000 students underground, and continuously we trained
With the fall of the Taliban, we went into the country, and we opened school after school
 We continuously opened clinics
 We had reproductive health training
 We had all kinds of training that you can imagine
 I was very happy
 I was delighted with the outcome of my work
 And one day, with four trainers and one bodyguard, I was going up north of Kabul, and all of a sudden, again, I was stopped in the middle of the road by 19 young men
 And I told my driver, "What's going on?" And the driver said, "I don't know
" He asked them
 They said, "We have nothing to do with you
" They called my name
 They said, "We want her
" My bodyguard got out, said, "I can answer you
 What do you want?" They said, "Nothing
" They called my name
 And by that time, the women are yelling and screaming inside the car
 I am very shaken up, and I told myself, this is it
 This time, we all are going to be killed
 There is no doubt in my mind
 But still, the moment comes, and you take strength from whatever you believe and whatever you do
 It's in your heart
 You believe in your worth, and you can walk on it
So I just hold myself on the side of the car
 And I asked them, "What can I do for you?" You know what they said to me? They said, "We know who you are
 Every day you go up north here and there
 You train women, you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job
 You build their skills
 How about us?"
"And you know, how about us? What are we going to do?" I looked at them, and I said, "I don't know
"
They said, "It's OK
 The only thing we can do, what we know, from the time we're born, we just hold the gun and kill
" And you know what that means
 It's a trap to me, of course
 So I walk out of there
 They said, "We'll let you go, go
" And so I walked into the car, I sit in the car, and I told the driver, "Turn around and go back to the office
 We only had money for women to train them, to send them to school, and nothing else
By the time I came to the office, of course my trainers were gone
 They ran away home
 Nobody stayed there
 My bodyguard was the only one there, and my voice was completely gone
 I was shaken up, and I sat on my table, and I said, "What am I going to do?" How am I going to solve this problem? Because we had training going on up north already
 Hundreds of women were there coming to get training
 And she asked me, "Sakena?" And I answered her
 She said, "It's not you
 What's wrong with you?" I said, "Nothing
" I tried to cover
 No matter what I tried to do, she didn't believe me, and she asked me again
 "OK, tell me what's going on?" I told her the whole story
" And when, two days later, I went the same route, and do you know, they were not in here, they were a little back further, the same young men, standing up there and holding the rifle and pointing to us to stop the car
 So we stopped the car
 I got out
 I said, "OK, let's go with me
" And they said, "Yes
" I said, "On one condition, that whatever I say, you accept it
" And they said, yes, they do
 Every area that is unknown to us in the mountain areas, they go with me
 They are ahead, and we go
 And they protect us
Thank you
That tells you that education transforms people
 When you educate people, they are going to be different, and today all over, we need to work for gender equality
So we started training men because the men should know the potential of women, know how much these potential men has, and how much these women can do the same job they are doing
 So we are continuously giving training to men, and I really believe strongly
 I live in a country that was a beautiful country
 I just want to share this with you
 It was a beautiful country, beautiful, peaceful country
 We were going everywhere
 Women were getting education: lawyer, engineer, teacher, and we were going from house to house
 We never locked our doors
 But you know what happened to my country
 Today, people cannot walk out of their door without security issues
 But we want the same Afghanistan we had before
 And I want to tell you the other side
 Today, the women of Afghanistan are working very, very hard
 They are earning degrees
 They are training to be lawyers
 They are training to be doctors, back again
 They are training to be teachers, and they are running businesses
 If you have these few things with you, you will accomplish
 We have one poet, Mawlānā Rūmī
 And if we could do it in Afghanistan, I am sure 100 percent that everyone can do it in any part of the world
Thank you
Wow, what an honor
 I always wondered what this would feel like
So eight years ago, I got the worst career advice of my life
 I had a friend tell me, "Don't worry about how much you like the work you're doing now
 It's all about just building your resume
"
And I'd just come back from living in Spain for a while, and I'd joined this Fortune 500 company
 I thought, "This is fantastic
 I'm going to have big impact on the world
" I had all these ideas
 I don't know if anyone's ever felt that
 And I noticed pretty soon after that that all the competitors in our space had already automated my job role
 And this is right about when I got this sage advice to build up my resume
Well, as I'm trying to figure out what two-story window I'm going to jump out of and change things up, I read some altogether different advice from Warren Buffett, and he said, "Taking jobs to build up your resume is the same as saving up sex for old age
"
And I heard that, and that was all I needed
 That's how tough it was
 I wanted to have some type of impact
 It didn't matter what it was
 I'm guessing this room is different, but that's the average that Deloitte has done with their studies
 So I wanted to find out, what is it that sets these people apart, the people who do the passionate, world-changing work, that wake up inspired every day, and then these people, the other 80 percent who lead these lives of quiet desperation
But as I was doing this, more and more people started to ask me, "You're into this career thing
 I don't like my job
 Can we sit down for lunch?" I'd say, "Sure
" But I would have to warn them, because at this point, my quit rate was also 80 percent
 Of the people I'd sit down with for lunch, 80 percent would quit their job within two months
 It was that I would ask one simple question
 It was, "Why are you doing the work that you're doing?" And so often their answer would be, "Well, because somebody told me I'm supposed to
The more time I spent around these people and saw this problem, I thought, what if we could create a community, a place where people could feel like they belonged and that it was OK to do things differently, to take the road less traveled, where that was encouraged, and inspire people to change? And that later became what I now call Live Your Legend, which I'll explain in a little bit
 But as I've made these discoveries, I noticed a framework of really three simple things that all these different passionate world-changers have in common, whether you're a Steve Jobs or if you're just, you know, the person that has the bakery down the street
 But you're doing work that embodies who you are
 I want to share those three with you, so we can use them as a lens for the rest of today and hopefully the rest of our life
The first part of this three-step passionate work framework is becoming a self-expert and understanding yourself, because if you don't know what you're looking for, you're never going to find it
 And the thing is that no one is going to do this for us
 There's no major in university on passion and purpose and career
 I don't know how that's not a required double major, but don't even get me started on that
 But the point is, it's on us to figure that out, and we need a framework, we need a way to navigate through this
And so the first step of our compass is finding out what our unique strengths are
 What are the things that we wake up loving to do no matter what, whether we're paid or we're not paid, the things that people thank us for? And the Strengths Finder 2
And next, what's our framework or our hierarchy for making decisions? Do we care about the people, our family, health, or is it achievement, success, all this stuff? We have to figure out what it is to make these decisions, so we know what our soul is made of, so that we don't go selling it to some cause we don't give a shit about
And then the next step is our experiences
 All of us have these experiences
 We learn things every day, every minute about what we love, what we hate, what we're good at, what we're terrible at
 And if we don't spend time paying attention to that and assimilating that learning and applying it to the rest of our lives, it's all for nothing
And even more so than that, as you see people, especially today, who inspire you, who are doing things where you say "Oh God, what Jeff is doing, I want to be like him
" Why are you saying that? Open up a journal
 It's not going to be everything about their life, but whatever it is, take note on that, so over time we'll have this repository of things that we can use to apply to our life and have a more passionate existence and make a better impact
 Because when we start to put these things together, we can then define what success actually means to us, and without these different parts of the compass, it's impossible
 We end up in the situation -- we have that scripted life that everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere
" He says, "Oh, it's simple
 More
" And he just smiles
 And it's the sad state of most of the people that haven't spent time understanding what matters for them, who keep reaching for something that doesn't mean anything to us, but we're doing it because everyone said we're supposed to
 But once we have this framework together, we can start to identify the things that make us come alive
 You know, before this, a passion could come and hit you in the face, or maybe in your possible line of work, you might throw it away because you don't have a way of identifying it
 But once you do, you can see something that's congruent with my strengths, my values, who I am as a person, so I'm going to grab ahold of this, I'm going to do something with it, and I'm going to pursue it and try to make an impact with it
And Live Your Legend and the movement we've built wouldn't exist if I didn't have this compass to identify, "Wow, this is something I want to pursue and make a difference with
" If we don't know what we're looking for, we're never going to find it, but once we have this framework, this compass, then we can move on to what's next -- and that's not me up there -- doing the impossible and pushing our limits
 There's two reasons why people don't do things
 One is they tell themselves they can't do them, or people around them tell them they can't do them
 Either way, we start to believe it
 Either we give up, or we never start in the first place
The things is, everyone was impossible until somebody did it
 Every invention, every new thing in the world, people thought were crazy at first
 Roger Bannister and the four-minute mile, it was a physical impossibility to break the four-minute mile in a foot race until Roger Bannister stood up and did it
 And then what happened? Two months later, 16 people broke the four-minute mile
 The things that we have in our head that we think are impossible are often just milestones waiting to be accomplished if we can push those limits a bit
 And I think this starts with probably your physical body and fitness more than anything, because we can control that
 If you don't think you can run a mile, you show yourself you can run a mile or two, or a marathon, or lose five pounds, or whatever it is, you realize that confidence compounds and can be transferred into the rest of your world
And I've actually gotten into the habit of this a little bit with my friends
 We have this little group
 We go on physical adventures, and recently, I found myself in a kind of precarious spot
 But anything above here, if it's murky, I can already feel it right now
 I swear there's something in there
 Even if it's Lake Tahoe, it's fresh water, totally unfounded fear, ridiculous, but it's there
 Anyway, three years ago I find myself on this tugboat right down here in the San Francisco Bay
 It's a rainy, stormy, windy day, and people are getting sick on the boat, and I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit, and I'm looking out the window in pure terror thinking I'm about to swim to my death
 And my guess is some people in this room might have done that before
 I'm sitting there, and my buddy Jonathan, who had talked me into it, he comes up to me and he could see the state I was in
 And he says, "Scott, hey man, what's the worst that could happen? You're wearing a wetsuit
 You're not going to sink
 And If you can't make it, just hop on one of the 20 kayaks
 Plus, if there's a shark attack, why are they going to pick you over the 80 people in the water?" So thanks, that helps
 He's like, "But really, just have fun with this
 Good luck
" And he dives in, swims off
 OK
Turns out, the pep talk totally worked, and I felt this total feeling of calm, and I think it was because Jonathan was 13 years old
And of the 80 people swimming that day, 65 of them were between the ages of nine and 13
 What would you have said yes to? What would you have not given up on? What would you have tried? As I'm finishing this swim, I get to Aquatic Park, and I'm getting out of the water and of course half the kids are already finished, so they're cheering me on and they're all excited
 And I got total popsicle head, if anyone's ever swam in the Bay, and I'm trying to just thaw my face out, and I'm watching people finish
 And I see this one kid, something didn't look right
 And he's barely able to sip some air before he slams his head back down
 And I notice other parents were watching too, and I swear they were thinking the same thing I was: this is why you don't let nine-year-olds swim from Alcatraz
 This was not fatigue
 And then all of a sudden they walk a few more feet and they plop him down in his wheelchair
 And he puts his fists up in the most insane show of victory I've ever seen
 I can still feel the warmth and the energy on this guy when he made this accomplishment
 I had seen him earlier that day in his wheelchair
 I just had no idea he was going to swim
 I mean, where is he going to be in 20 years? How many people told him he couldn't do that, that he would die if tried that?
 You don't have to be the fastest marathoner in the world, just your own impossibilities, to accomplish those, and it starts with little bitty steps
 And the best way to do this is to surround yourself with passionate people
 The fastest things to do things you don't think can be done is to surround yourself with people already doing them
There's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says
" And there is no bigger lifehack in the history of the world from getting where you are today to where you want to be than the people you choose to put in your corner
 In 1898, Norman Triplett did this study with a bunch of cyclists, and he would measure their times around the track in a group, and also individually
 And he found that every time the cyclists in the group would cycle faster
 And it's been repeated in all kinds of walks of life since then, and it proves the same thing over again, that the people around you matter, and environment is everything
 But it's on you to control it, because it can go both ways
 With 80 percent of people who don't like the work they do, that means most people around us, not in this room, but everywhere else, are encouraging complacency and keeping us from pursuing the things that matter to us so we have to manage those surroundings
I found myself in this situation -- personal example, a couple years ago
 Has anyone ever had a hobby or a passion they poured their heart and soul into, unbelievable amount of time, and they so badly want to call it a business, but no one's paying attention and it doesn't make a dime? OK, I was there for four years trying to build this Live Your Legend movement to help people do work that they genuinely cared about and that inspired them, and I was doing all I could, and there were only three people paying attention, and they're all right there: my mother, father and my wife, Chelsea
 Thank you guys for the support
And this is how badly I wanted it, it grew at zero percent for four years, and I was about to shut it down, and right about then, I moved to San Francisco and started to meet some pretty interesting people who had these crazy lifestyles of adventure, of businesses and websites and blogs that surrounded their passions and helped people in a meaningful way
 And one of my friends, now, he has a family of eight, and he supports his whole family with a blog that he writes for twice a week
 They just came back from a month in Europe, all of them together
 This blew my mind
 How does this even exist? And I got unbelievably inspired by seeing this, and instead of shutting it down, I decided, let's take it seriously
 And I did everything I could to spend my time, every waking hour possible trying to hound these guys, hanging out and having beers and workouts, whatever it was
 And after four years of zero growth, within six months of hanging around these people, the community at Live Your Legend grew by 10 times
 In another 12 months, it grew by 160 times
 And today over 30,000 people from 158 countries use our career and connection tools on a monthly basis
 Well, for four years, I knew nobody in this space, and I didn't even know it existed, that people could do this stuff, that you could have movements like this
 It became normal, so my thinking went from how could I possibly do this to how could I possibly not
 And right then, when that happens, that switch goes on in your head, it ripples across your whole world
 You just need to change your surroundings
 That's it, and that's why I love being around this whole group of people, why I go to every TED event I can, and watch them on my iPad on the way to work, whatever it is
 We have a whole day to spend together and plenty more
To sum things up, in terms of these three pillars, they all have one thing in common more than anything else
 They are 100 percent in our control
 No one can tell you you can't learn about yourself
 No one can tell you you can't push your limits and learn your own impossible and push that
 No one can tell you you can't surround yourself with inspiring people or get away from the people who bring you down
 You can't control a recession
 You can't control getting fired or getting in a car accident
 Most things are totally out of our hands
 These three things are totally on us, and they can change our whole world if we decide to do something about it
And the thing is, it's starting to happen on a widespread level
 I just read in Forbes, the US Government reported for the first time in a month where more people had quit their jobs than had been laid off
 They thought this was an anomaly, but it's happened three months straight
 In a time where people claim it's kind of a tough environment, people are giving a middle finger to this scripted life, the things that people say you're supposed to do, in exchange for things that matter to them and do the things that inspire them
 That's not a cliché anymore
 I don't care what it is that you're into, what passion, what hobby
 If you're into knitting, you can find someone who is killing it knitting, and you can learn from them
 It's wild
 And that's what this whole day is about, to learn from the folks speaking, and we profile these people on Live Your Legend every day, because when ordinary people are doing the extraordinary, and we can be around that, it becomes normal
 And this isn't about being Gandhi or Steve Jobs, doing something crazy
Speaking of Gandhi, he was a recovering lawyer, as I've heard the term, and he was called to a greater cause, something that mattered to him, he couldn't not do
 And he has this quote that I absolutely live by
 "First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win
Everything was impossible until somebody did it
 You can either hang around the people who tell you it can't be done and tell you you're stupid for trying, or surround yourself with the people who inspire possibility, the people who are in this room
 Because I see it as our responsibility to show the world that what's seen as impossible can become that new normal
 And that's already starting to happen
 First, do the things that inspire us, so we can inspire other people to do the things that inspire them
 But we can't find that unless we know what we're looking for
 We have to do our work on ourself, be intentional about that, and make those discoveries
 Because I imagine a world where 80 percent of people love the work they do
 What would that look like? What would the innovation be like? How would you treat the people around you? Things would start to change
And as we finish up, I have just one question to ask you guys, and I think it's the only question that matters
 What is the work you can't not do?
I published this article in the New York Times Modern Love column in January of this year
 "To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This
So the procedure is fairly simple: two strangers take turns asking each other 36 increasingly personal questions and then they stare into each other's eyes without speaking for four minutes
So here are a couple of sample questions
 If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?
 When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself?
So when I first came across this study a few years earlier, one detail really stuck out to me, and that was the rumor that two of the participants had gotten married six months later, and they'd invited the entire lab to the ceremony
 So I was of course very skeptical about this process of just manufacturing romantic love, but of course I was intrigued
 And when I got the chance to try this study myself, with someone I knew but not particularly well, I wasn't expecting to fall in love
And I thought it made a good story, so I sent it to the Modern Love column a few months later
Now, this was published in January, and now it is August, so I'm guessing that some of you are probably wondering, are we still together? And the reason I think you might be wondering this is because I have been asked this question again and again and again for the past seven months
 And this question is really what I want to talk about today
 But let's come back to it
 I had been working on a book about love stories for the past few years, so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with romantic love on my blog
 But a blog post might get a couple hundred views at the most, and those were usually just my Facebook friends, and I figured my article in the New York Times would probably get a few thousand views
 And that felt like a lot of attention on a relatively new relationship
 But as it turned out, I had no idea
So the article was published online on a Friday evening, and by Saturday, this had happened to the traffic on my blog
 Within a month, the article would receive over 8 million views, and I was, to say the least, underprepared for this sort of attention
 It's one thing to work up the confidence to write honestly about your experiences with love, but it is another thing to discover that your love life has made international news --
and to realize that people across the world are genuinely invested in the status of your new relationship
And when people called or emailed, which they did every day for weeks, they always asked the same question first: are you guys still together? In fact, as I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search of my email inbox for the phrase "Are you still together?" and several messages popped up immediately
 They were from students and journalists and friendly strangers like this one
 I even gave a talk, and one woman shouted up to the stage, "Hey Mandy, where's your boyfriend?" And I promptly turned bright red
 If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it
 The 36 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own
 In fact, the New York Times published a follow-up article for Valentine's Day, which featured readers' experiences of trying the study themselves, with varying degrees of success
So my first impulse in the face of all of this attention was to become very protective of my own relationship
 I turned down TV interviews, and I said no to every request for photos of the two us
 I think I was afraid that we would become inadvertent icons for the process of falling in love, a position I did not at all feel qualified for
 people didn't just want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really worked: that is, if it was capable of producing love that would last, not just a fling, but real love, sustainable love
But this was a question I didn't feel capable of answering
 Arthur Aron first wrote about these questions in this study here in 1997, and here, the researcher's goal was not to produce romantic love
 Instead, they wanted to foster interpersonal closeness among college students, by using what Aron called "sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure
 They've used it between members of the police and members of community, and they've used it between people of opposing political ideologies
 The original version of the story, the one that I tried last summer, that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was referenced in this article, but unfortunately it was never published
 "You mean, you didn't fall in love with the person you did it with?" I asked
"Well
" He paused
 "I think she just wants to be friends
"But did you become better friends?" I asked
 "Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study?" He nodded
"So, then it worked," I said
I don't think this is the answer he was looking for
 In fact, I don't think this is the answer that any of us are looking for when it comes to love
 I had been in the relationship since I was 20, which was basically my entire adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him
 So I turned to science
 I researched everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I think I was hoping that it might somehow inoculate me from heartache
 I don't know if I realized this at the time -- I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing -- but it seems really obvious in retrospect
 I hoped that if I armed myself with the knowledge of romantic love, I might never have to feel as terrible and lonely as I did then
 And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways
 I am more patient with love
 I am more relaxed
 I am more confident about asking for what I want
 But I can also see myself more clearly, and I can see that what I want is sometimes more than can reasonably be asked for
 Maybe it's this possibility of a guarantee that people were really asking about when they wanted to know if we were still together
So the story that the media told about the 36 questions was that there might be a shortcut to falling in love
 There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved, and this is a very appealing story, because falling in love feels amazing, but it's also terrifying
 The moment you admit to loving someone, you admit to having a lot to lose, and it's true that these questions do provide a mechanism for getting to know someone quickly, which is also a mechanism for being known, and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love: to be known, to be seen, to be understood
 But I think when it comes to love, we are too willing to accept the short version of the story
 The version of the story that asks, "Are you still together?" and is content with a yes or no answer
So rather than that question, I would propose we ask some more difficult questions, questions like: How do you decide who deserves your love and who does not? How do you stay in love when things get difficult, and how do you know when to just cut and run? How do you live with the doubt that inevitably creeps into every relationship, or even harder, how do you live with your partner's doubt? I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're an important start at having a more thoughtful conversation about what it means to love someone
So, if you want it, the short version of the story of my relationship is this: a year ago, an acquaintance and I did a study designed to create romantic love, and we fell in love, and we are still together, and I am so glad
 Falling in love is the easy part
 So at the end of my article, I wrote, "Love didn't happen to us
" And I cringe a little when I read that now, not because it isn't true, but because at the time, I really hadn't considered everything that was contained in that choice
 I want it to be enough to have asked and answered 36 questions, and to have chosen to love someone so generous and kind and fun and to have broadcast that choice in the biggest newspaper in America
 But what I have done instead is turn my relationship into the kind of myth I don't quite believe in
 And what I want, what perhaps I will spend my life wanting, is for that myth to be true
I want the happy ending implied by the title to my article, which is, incidentally, the only part of the article that I didn't actually write
But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone, and the hope that he will choose to love me back, and it is terrifying, but that's the deal with love
Thank you
Wait, wait
 What? What do men have to do with gender equality? Gender equality is about women, right? I mean, the word gender is about women
 Actually, I'm even here speaking as a middle class white man
 So we did what graduate students typically do in a situation like that
 We said, OK, let's have a study group
We would read some text in feminist theory and have a conversation about it
 And during one of our conversations, I witnessed an interaction that changed my life forever
 One of the women was white, and one was black
 And the white woman said -- this is going to sound very anachronistic now -- the white woman said, "All women face the same oppression as women
 All women are similarly situated in patriarchy, and therefore all women have a kind of intuitive solidarity or sisterhood
" And the black woman said, "I'm not so sure
 Let me ask you a question
" So the black woman says to the white woman, "When you wake up in the morning and you look in the mirror, what do you see?" And the white woman said, "I see a woman
" And the black woman said, "You see, that's the problem for me
 Because when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror," she said, "I see a black woman
 But to you, race is invisible
" And then she said something really startling
 She said, "That's how privilege works
 Privilege is invisible to those who have it
Now remember, I was the only man in this group, so when I witnessed this, I went, "Oh no
"
And somebody said, "Well what was that reaction?" And I said, "Well, when I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror, I see a human being
 I'm kind of the generic person
 I have no race, no class, no gender
 I'm universally generalizable
So I like to think that was the moment I became a middle class white man, that class and race and gender were not about other people, they were about me
Now, I wish I could tell you this story ends 30 years ago in that little discussion group, but I was reminded of it quite recently at my university where I teach
 I have a colleague, and she and I both teach the sociology of gender course on alternate semesters
 So she gives a guest lecture for me when I teach
 I give a guest lecture for her when she teaches
 So I walk into her class to give a guest lecture, about 300 students in the room, and as I walk in, one of the students looks up and says, "Oh, finally, an objective opinion
"
 I mean, if you were to say to my students, "There is structural inequality based on gender in the United States," they'd say, "Well of course you'd say that
 You're a woman
 You're biased
" When I say it, they go, "Wow, is that interesting
 Is that going to be on the test? How do you spell 'structural'?"
So I hope you all can see, this is what objectivity looks like
 
And that, by the way, is why I think men so often wear ties
Because if you are going to embody disembodied Western rationality, you need a signifier, and what could be a better signifier of disembodied Western rationality than a garment that at one end is a noose and the other end points to the genitals?
 
That is mind-body dualism right there
So making gender visible to men is the first step to engaging men to support gender equality
Now, when men first hear about gender equality, when they first start thinking about it, they often think, many men think, well, that's right, that's fair, that's just, that's the ethical imperative
 But not all men
 Some men think -- the lightning bolt goes off, and they go, "Oh my God, yes, gender equality," and they will immediately begin to mansplain to you your oppression
 They see supporting gender equality something akin to the calvary, like, "Thanks very much for bringing this to our attention, ladies, we'll take it from here
" This results in a syndrome that I like to call 'premature self-congratulation
'
 
There's another group, though, that actively resists gender equality, that sees gender equality as something that is detrimental to men
 This is the beginning of the book I wrote, 'Angry White Men
' These were four angry white men who believed that they, white men in America, were the victims of reverse discrimination in the workplace
 And they all told stories about how they were qualified for jobs, qualified for promotions, they didn't get them, they were really angry
 And the reason I'm telling you this is I want you to hear the title of this particular show
 It was a quote from one of the men, and the quote was, "A Black Woman Stole My Job
" And they all told their stories, qualified for jobs, qualified for promotions, didn't get it, really angry
 And then it was my turn to speak, and I said, "I have just one question for you guys, and it's about the title of the show, 'A Black Woman Stole My Job
' Actually, it's about one word in the title
 I want to know about the word 'my
' Where did you get the idea it was your job? Why isn't the title of the show, 'A Black Woman Got the Job?' or 'A Black Woman Got A Job?'" Because without confronting men's sense of entitlement, I don't think we'll ever understand why so many men resist gender equality
Look, we think this is a level playing field, so any policy that tilts it even a little bit, we think, "Oh my God, water's rushing uphill
 It's reverse discrimination against us
"
So let me be very clear: white men in Europe and the United States are the beneficiaries of the single greatest affirmative action program in the history of the world
 It is called "the history of the world
"
 
 But more than that, gender equality is also in our interest as men
 If you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives, gender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live
Gender equality is good for countries
 It turns out, according to most studies, that those countries that are the most gender equal are also the countries that score highest on the happiness scale
 And that's not just because they're all in Europe
Even within Europe, those countries that are more gender equal also have the highest levels of happiness
It is also good for companies
 Research by Catalyst and others has shown conclusively that the more gender-equal companies are, the better it is for workers, the happier their labor force is
 They have lower job turnover
 They have lower levels of attrition
 They have an easier time recruiting
 They have higher rates of retention, higher job satisfaction, higher rates of productivity
 So the question I'm often asked in companies is, "Boy, this gender equality thing, that's really going to be expensive, huh?" And I say, "Oh no, in fact, what you have to start calculating is how much gender inequality is already costing you
 It is extremely expensive
" So it is good for business
And the other thing is, it's good for men
 It is good for the kind of lives we want to live, because young men especially have changed enormously, and they want to have lives that are animated by terrific relationships with their children
 They expect their partners, their spouses, their wives, to work outside the home and be just as committed to their careers as they are
I was talking, to give you an illustration of this change -- Some of you may remember this
 When I was a lot younger, there was a riddle that was posed to us
 Some of you may wince to remember this riddle
 This riddle went something like this
" How is this possible?
We were flummoxed by this
Well, I decided to do a little experiment with my 16-year old son
 He had a bunch of his friends hanging out at the house watching a game on TV recently
" Right? No problem
 Just like that
 Except for my son, who said, "Well, he could have two dads
"
That's an index, an indicator of how things have changed
 Younger men today expect to be able to balance work and family
 They want to be dual-career, dual-carer couples
 They want to be able to balance work and family with their partners
Now, it turns out that the more egalitarian our relationships, the happier both partners are
 Data from psychologists and sociologists are quite persuasive here
 I think we have the persuasive numbers, the data, to prove to men that gender equality is not a zero-sum game, but a win-win
 Here's what the data show
 Now, when men begin the process of engaging with balancing work and family, we often have two phrases that we use to describe what we do
 We pitch in and we help out
And I'm going to propose something a little bit more radical, one word: "share
"
 They are less likely to be diagnosed with ADHD
 They are less likely to be put on medication
So when men share housework and childcare, their children are happier and healthier, and men want this
When men share housework and childcare, their wives are happier
 Duh
 Not only that, their wives are healthier
 So when men share housework and childcare, their wives are happier and healthier, and men certainly want this as well
 When men share housework and childcare, the men are healthier
 They smoke less, drink less, take recreational drugs less often
 They are less likely to go to the ER but more like to go to a doctor for routine screenings
 They are less likely to see a therapist, less likely to be diagnosed with depression, less likely to be taking prescription medication
 So when men share housework and childcare, the men are happier and healthier
 And who wouldn't want that?
And finally, when men share housework and childcare, they have more sex
Now, of these four fascinating findings, which one do you think Men's Health magazine put on its cover?
Now, I will say, just to remind the men in the audience, these data were collected over a really long period of time, so I don't want listeners to say, "Hmm, OK, I think I'll do the dishes tonight
 But I think it shows something important, that when Men's Health magazine put it on their cover, they also called, you'll love this, "Choreplay
"
So, what we found is something really important, that gender equality is in the interest of countries, of companies, and of men, and their children and their partners, that gender equality is not a zero-sum game
 And what we also know is we cannot fully empower women and girls unless we engage boys and men
In 1915, on the eve of one of the great suffrage demonstrations down Fifth Avenue in New York City, a writer in New York wrote an article in a magazine, and the title of the article was, "Feminism for Men
" And this was the first line of that article: "Feminism will make it possible for the first time for men to be free
"
Thank you
For the last 50 years, a lot of smart, well-resourced people -- some of you, no doubt -- have been trying to figure out how to reduce poverty in the United States
 People have created and invested millions of dollars into non-profit organizations with the mission of helping people who are poor
They've created think tanks that study issues like education, job creation and asset-building, and then advocated for policies to support our most marginalized communities
 They've written books and columns and given passionate speeches, decrying the wealth gap that is leaving more and more people entrenched at the bottom end of the income scale
 And that effort has helped
 But it's not enough
 Our poverty rates haven't changed that much in the last 50 years, since the War on Poverty was launched
 I'm here to tell you that we have overlooked the most powerful and practical resource
 Here it is: people who are poor
 They met when they all had small children, through a parenting class at a family resource center in San Francisco
 As they grew together as parents and friends, they talked a lot about how hard it was to make money when your kids are little
 Their husbands worked, but they wanted to contribute financially, too
So they hatched a plan
 They started a cleaning business
 They plastered neighborhoods with flyers and handed business cards out to their families and friends, and soon, they had clients calling
 Two of them would clean the office or house and one of them would watch the kids
 They'd rotate who'd cleaned and who'd watch the kids
And they split the money three ways
 It was not a full-time gig, no one could watch the little ones all day
 But it made a difference for their families
 Extra money to pay for bills when a husband's work hours were cut
 Money to buy the kids clothes as they were growing
Up in the top-right corner is Theresa and her daughter, Brianna
 Brianna is one of those kids with this sparkly, infectious, outgoing personality
 For example, when Rosie, a little girl who spoke only Spanish, moved in next door, Brianna, who spoke only English, borrowed her mother's tablet and found a translation app so the two of them could communicate
I know, right? Rosie's family credits Brianna with helping Rosie to learn English
A few years ago, Brianna started to struggle academically
 She was growing frustrated and kind of withdrawn and acting out in class
 And her mother was heartbroken over what was happening
 Then they found out that she was going to have to repeat second grade and Brianna was devastated
 Her mother felt hopeless and overwhelmed and alone because she knew that her daughter was not getting the support she needed, and she did not know how to help her
 One afternoon, Theresa was catching up with a group of friends, and one of them said, "Theresa, how are you?" And she burst into tears
 After she shared her story, one of her friends said, "I went through the exact same thing with my son about a year ago
" And in that moment, Theresa realized that so much of her struggle was not having anybody to talk with about it
 So she created a support group for parents like her
 The first meeting was her and two other people
 But word spread, and soon 20 people, 30 people were showing up for these monthly meetings that she put together
 She went from feeling helpless to realizing how capable she was of supporting her daughter, with the support of other people who were going through the same struggle
That in the middle is my man Baakir, standing in front of BlackStar Books and Caffe, which he runs out of part of his house
 As you walk in the door, Baakir greets you with a "Welcome black home
"
Once inside, you can order some Algiers jerk chicken, perhaps a vegan walnut burger, or jive turkey sammich
 You must finish your meal with a buttermilk drop, which is several steps above a donut hole and made from a very secret family recipe
 For real, it's very secret, he won't tell you about it
But BlackStar is much more than a café
 For the kids in the neighborhood, it's a place to go after school to get help with homework
 For the grown-ups, it's where they go to find out what's going on in the neighborhood and catch up with friends
 It's a performance venue
 It's a home for poets, musicians and artists
 Baakir and his partner Nicole, with their baby girl strapped to her back, are there in the mix of it all, serving up a cup of coffee, teaching a child how to play Mancala, or painting a sign for an upcoming community event
I have worked with and learned from people just like them for more than 20 years
 I have organized against the prison system, which impacts poor folks, especially black, indigenous and Latino folks, at an alarming rate
 I have worked with young people who manifest hope and promise, despite being at the effect of racist discipline practices in their schools, and police violence in their communities
 I have learned from families who are unleashing their ingenuity and tenacity to collectively create their own solutions
 And they're not just focused on money
 They're addressing education, housing, health, community -- the things that we all care about
 Everywhere I go, I see people who are broke but not broken
 Jobana, Sintia, Bertha, Theresa and Baakir are the rule, not the shiny exception
 I am the exception
I was raised by a quietly fierce single mother in Rochester, New York
 At eight, I was a latchkey kid
 I'd get myself home after school every day and do homework and chores, and wait for my mother to come home
 After school, I'd go to the corner store and buy a can of Chef Boyardee ravioli, which I'd heat up on the stove as my afternoon snack
 If I had a little extra money, I'd buy a Hostess Fruit Pie
Cherry
We were poor when I was a kid
 But now, I own a home in a quickly gentrifying neighborhood in Oakland, California
 I've built a career
 My husband is a business owner
 I have a retirement account
 My daughter is not even allowed to turn on the stove unless there's a grown-up at home and she doesn't have to, because she does not have to have the same kind of self-reliance that I had to at her age
 My kids' raviolis are organic and full of things like spinach and ricotta, because I have the luxury of choice when it comes to what my children eat
I am the exception, not because I'm more talented than Baakir or my mother worked any harder than Jobana, Sintia or Bertha, or cared any more than Theresa
 They are full of people tapping into their resilience to get up every day, get the kids off to school and go to jobs that don't pay enough, or get educations that are putting them in debt
 They are full of people applying their savvy intelligence to stretch a minimum wage paycheck, or balance a job and a side hustle to make ends meet
 They are full of people doing for themselves and for others, whether it's picking up medication for an elderly neighbor, or letting a sibling borrow some money to pay the phone bill, or just watching out for the neighborhood kids from the front stoop
I am the exception because of luck and privilege, not hard work
 And I'm not being modest or self-deprecating -- I am amazing
But most people work hard
Thank you
 because that story allows those of us who make it to believe we deserve it, and by implication, those who don't make it don't deserve it
 We tell ourselves, in the back of our minds, and sometimes in the front of our mouths, "There must be something a little wrong with those poor people
" We have a wide range of beliefs about what that something wrong is
 Some people tell the story that poor folks are lazy freeloaders who would cheat and lie to get out of an honest day's work
 Others prefer the story that poor people are helpless and probably had neglectful parents that didn't read to them enough, and if they were just told what to do and shown the right path, they could make it
For every story I hear demonizing low-income single mothers or absentee fathers, which is how people might think of my parents, I've got 50 that tell a different story about the same people, showing up every day and doing their best
 I'm not saying that some of the negative stories aren't true, but those stories allow us to not really see who people really are, because they don't paint a full picture
 The quarter-truths and limited plot lines have us convinced that poor people are a problem that needs fixing
 What if we recognized that what's working is the people and what's broken is our approach? What if we realized that the experts we are looking for, the experts we need to follow, are poor people themselves? What if, instead of imposing solutions, we just added fire to the already-burning flame that they have? Not directing -- not even empowering -- but just fueling their initiative
Just north of here, we have an example of what this could look like: Silicon Valley
Right? But where is our strategy for Theresa and Baakir? There are no incubators for them, no accelerators, no fellowships
I'm going to take a minute to speak to my people
 We cannot wait for somebody else to get it right
 Let us remember that we are magic
 If you need some inspiration to jog your memory, read Octavia Butler's "Parable of the Sower
" Listen to Reverend King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail
" Set your gaze upon the art of Kehinde Wiley or Favianna Rodriguez
 We are magic
 And we spend a lot of our time and energy organizing our power to demand change from systems that were not made for us
 Instead of trying to alter the fabric of existing ways, let's weave and cut some fierce new cloth
 Let's use some of our substantial collective power toward inventing and bringing to life new ways of being that work for us
Desmond Tutu talks about the concept of ubuntu, in the context of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation process that they embarked on after apartheid
 He says it means, "My humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up, in yours; we belong to a bundle of life
" A bundle of life
 The Truth and Reconciliation process started by elevating the voices of the unheard
 If this country is going to live up to its promise of liberty and justice for all, then we need to elevate the voices of our unheard, of people like Jobana, Sintia and Bertha, Theresa and Baakir
 We must leverage their solutions and their ideas
 We must listen to their true stories, their more beautifully complex stories
 I would like you to feel comfortable with my doing that by letting you know that I know something about fear and anxiety
 I'm a Jewish guy from New Jersey
I could worry before I could walk
Thank you
But I also grew up in a time where there was something to fear
 We were brought out in the hall when I was a little kid and taught how to put our coats over our heads to protect us from global thermonuclear war
 Now even my seven-year-old brain knew that wasn't going to work
 But I also knew that global thermonuclear war was something to be concerned with
 We created the space program in response to that
 We built our highway system in response to that
 We created the Internet in response to that
 So sometimes fear can produce a constructive response
On September 11, 2001, 19 guys took over four airplanes and flew them into a couple of buildings
 They exacted a horrible toll
 It is not for us to minimize what that toll was
 But the response that we had was clearly disproportionate -- disproportionate to the point of verging on the unhinged
 We rearranged the national security apparatus of the United States and of many governments to address a threat that, at the time that those attacks took place, was quite limited
 In fact, according to our intelligence services, on September 11, 2001, there were 100 members of core Al-Qaeda
 They posed an existential threat to no one
But we rearranged our entire national security apparatus in the most sweeping way since the end of the Second World War
 We spent trillions of dollars
 We suspended our values
 We violated international law
 We embraced torture
 We embraced the idea that if these 19 guys could do this, anybody could do it
 And therefore, for the first time in history, we were seeing everybody as a threat
 And what was the result of that? Surveillance programs that listened in on the emails and phone calls of entire countries -- hundreds of millions of people -- setting aside whether those countries were our allies, setting aside what our interests were
 I would argue that 15 years later, since today there are more terrorists, more terrorist attacks, more terrorist casualties -- this by the count of the U
 State Department -- since today the region from which those attacks emanate is more unstable than at any time in its history, since the Flood, perhaps, we have not succeeded in our response
Now you have to ask, where did we go wrong? What did we do? What was the mistake that was made? And you might say, well look, Washington is a dysfunctional place
 There are political food fights
 We've turned our discourse into a cage match
 And that's true
 But there are bigger problems, believe it or not, than that dysfunction, even though I would argue that dysfunction that makes it impossible to get anything done in the richest and most powerful country in the world is far more dangerous than anything that a group like ISIS could do, because it stops us in our tracks and it keeps us from progress
But there are other problems
 And the other problems came from the fact that in Washington and in many capitals right now, we're in a creativity crisis
 In Washington, in think tanks, where people are supposed to be thinking of new ideas, you don't get bold new ideas, because if you offer up a bold new idea, not only are you attacked on Twitter, but you will not get confirmed in a government job
 Because we are reactive to the heightened venom of the political debate, you get governments that have an us-versus-them mentality, tiny groups of people making decisions
 When you sit in a room with a small group of people making decisions, what do you get? You get groupthink
 That's a danger
 And so the parts of the U
 government that do foresight, that look forward, that do strategy -- the parts in other governments that do this -- can't do it, because they're reacting to the news cycle
 And so we're not looking ahead
On 9/11, we had a crisis because we were looking the wrong way
 Today we have a crisis because, because of 9/11, we are still looking in the wrong direction, and we know because we see transformational trends on the horizon that are far more important than what we saw on 9/11; far more important than the threat posed by these terrorists; far more important even than the instability that we've got in some areas of the world that are racked by instability today
 They may be a reaction to bigger trends
 And if we are treating the symptom and ignoring the bigger trend, then we've got far bigger problems to deal with
And so what are those trends? Well, to a group like you, the trends are apparent
 We are living at a moment in which the very fabric of human society is being rewoven
 They would have a small computer connected to the Internet in their pocket
 In most of Africa, the cell phone penetration rate is 80 percent
 We passed the point last October when there were more mobile cellular devices, SIM cards, out in the world than there were people
 And the changes associated with that are changing the very nature of every aspect of governance and life on the planet in ways that our leaders ought to be thinking about, when they're thinking about these immediate threats
On the security side, we've come out of a Cold War in which it was too costly to fight a nuclear war, and so we didn't, to a period that I call Cool War, cyber war, where the costs of conflict are actually so low, that we may never stop
 We may enter a period of constant warfare, and we know this because we've been in it for several years
 And yet, we don't have the basic doctrines to guide us in this regard
 If someone attacks us with a cyber attack, do have the ability to respond with a kinetic attack? We don't know
 If somebody launches a cyber attack, how do we deter them? When China launched a series of cyber attacks, what did the U
S
 government do? It said, we're going to indict a few of these Chinese guys, who are never coming to America
 They're never going to be anywhere near a law enforcement officer who's going to take them into custody
Special forces operators out there in the field today discover that small groups of insurgents with cell phones have access to satellite imagery that once only superpowers had
 In fact, if you've got a cell phone, you've got access to power that a superpower didn't have, and would have highly classified 10 years ago
 They have apps that allow them to know what their adversary is about to do
 They're using these tools in new ways
 When a cafe in Sydney was taken over by a terrorist, he went in with a rifle
 and an iPad
 And the weapon was the iPad
 Because he captured people, he terrorized them, he pointed the iPad at them, and then he took the video and he put it on the Internet, and he took over the world's media
 The relations between great powers -- we thought we were past the bipolar era
 We thought we were in a unipolar world, where all the big issues were resolved
 Remember? It was the end of history
 But we're not
 We're now seeing that our basic assumptions about the Internet -- that it was going to connect us, weave society together -- are not necessarily true
 In countries like China, you have the Great Firewall of China
 You've got countries saying no, if the Internet happens within our borders we control it within our borders
 We control the content
 We are going to control our security
 We are going to manage that Internet
 We are going to say what can be on it
 We're going to set a different set of rules
 Now you might think, well, that's just China
 But it's not just China
 It's China, India, Russia
 It's Saudi Arabia, it's Singapore, it's Brazil
 After the NSA scandal, the Russians, the Chinese, the Indians, the Brazilians, they said, let's create a new Internet backbone, because we can't be dependent on this other one
 And so all of a sudden, what do you have? You have a new bipolar world in which cyber-internationalism, our belief, is challenged by cyber-nationalism, another belief
We are seeing these changes everywhere we look
 We are seeing the advent of mobile money
 It's happening in the places you wouldn't expect
 It's happening in Kenya and Tanzania, where millions of people who haven't had access to financial services now conduct all those services on their phones
 There are 2
5 million people who don't have financial service access that are going to get it soon
 A billion of them are going to have the ability to access it on their cell phone soon
 It's not just going to give them the ability to bank
 It's going to change what monetary policy is
 It's going to change what money is
 Education is changing in the same way
 Healthcare is changing in the same way
And yet, in Washington, we are debating whether to call the terrorist group that has taken over Syria and Iraq ISIS or ISIL or Islamic State
 We are trying to determine how much we want to give in a negotiation with the Iranians on a nuclear deal which deals with the technologies of 50 years ago, when in fact, we know that the Iranians right now are engaged in cyber war with us and we're ignoring it, partially because businesses are not willing to talk about the attacks that are being waged on them
And that gets us to another breakdown that's crucial, and another breakdown that couldn't be more important to a group like this, because the growth of America and real American national security and all of the things that drove progress even during the Cold War, was a public-private partnership between science, technology and government that began when Thomas Jefferson sat alone in his laboratory inventing new things
 But it was the canals and railroads and telegraph; it was radar and the Internet
 It was Tang, the breakfast drink -- probably not the most important of those developments
 It's broken down because there is, believe it or not, in Washington, a war on science -- despite the fact that in all of human history, every time anyone has waged a war on science, science has won
 In the nuclear age, when there were people in senior national security jobs, they were expected to speak throw-weight
 If you went to the highest level of the U
 government now and said, "Talk to me about cyber, about neuroscience, about the things that are going to change the world of tomorrow," you'd get a blank stare
 I know, because when I wrote this book, I talked to 150 people, many from the science and tech side, who felt like they were being shunted off to the kids' table
 Meanwhile, on the tech side, we have lots of wonderful people creating wonderful things, but they started in garages and they didn't need the government and they don't want the government
 Many of them have a political view that's somewhere between libertarian and anarchic: leave me alone
But the world's coming apart
 All of a sudden, there are going to be massive regulatory changes and massive issues associated with conflict and massive issues associated with security and privacy
 And we haven't even gotten to the next set of issues, which are philosophical issues
 If you can't vote, if you can't have a job, if you can't bank, if you can't get health care, if you can't be educated without Internet access, is Internet access a fundamental right that should be written into constitutions? If Internet access is a fundamental right, is electricity access for the 1
2 billion who don't have access to electricity a fundamental right? These are fundamental issues
 I live in Washington
 These big issues that will change the world, change national security, change economics, create hope, create threats, can only be resolved when you bring together groups of people who understand science and technology back together with government
 And until we recreate that connection, until we do what helped America grow and helped other countries grow, then we are going to grow ever more vulnerable
 The risks associated with 9/11 will not be measured in terms of lives lost by terror attacks or buildings destroyed or trillions of dollars spent
 They'll be measured in terms of the costs of our distraction from critical issues and our inability to get together scientists, technologists, government leaders, at a moment of transformation akin to the beginning of the Renaissance, akin to the beginning of the major transformational eras that have happened on Earth, and start coming up with, if not the right answers, then at least the right questions
We are not there yet, but discussions like this and groups like you are the places where those questions can be formulated and posed
 And that's why I believe that groups like TED, discussions like this around the planet, are the place where the future of foreign policy, of economic policy, of social policy, of philosophy, will ultimately take place
 And that's why it's been a pleasure speaking to you
Thank you very, very much
 Hi, everyone!
Thanks, Pat
 Thank you! Getting me all wound up, now!
 Good! You know, when I was watching the video again of the match, you must have felt like the fate of the world's women was on every stroke you took
 He was one of my heroes and I admired him
 And that's the reason I beat him, actually, because I respected him
It's true -- my mom and especially my dad always said: "Respect your opponent, and never underestimate them, ever
" And he was correct
 He was absolutely correct
 But I knew it was about social change
 And I was really nervous whenever we announced it, and I felt like the whole world was on my shoulders
" Title IX had just been passed the year before -- June 23, 1972
 And women's professional tennis -- there were nine of us who signed a one-dollar contract in 1970 -- now remember, the match is in '73
 So we were only in our third year of having a tour where we could actually play, have a place to compete and make a living
 So there were nine of us that signed that one-dollar contract
 And our dream was for any girl, born any place in the world -- if she was good enough -- there would be a place for her to compete and for us to make a living
 Because before 1968, we made 14 dollars a day, and we were under the control of organizations
 So we really wanted to break away from that
 But we knew it wasn't really about our generation so much; we knew it was about the future generations
We do stand on the shoulders of the people that came before us, there is no question
 I really wanted to start matching the hearts and minds to Title IX
 And that changed everything
 So that was on my mind
 I wanted to start that change in the hearts and minds
But two things came out of that match
 For women: self-confidence, empowerment
 They actually had enough nerve to ask for a raise
 I said, "More importantly, did you get it?"
And they did! And for the men? A lot of the men today don't realize it, but if you're in your 50s, 60s or whatever, late 40s, you're the first generation of men of the Women's Movement -- whether you like it or not!
And for the men, what happened for the men, they'd come up to me -- and most times, the men are the ones who have tears in their eyes, it's very interesting
 They go, "Billie, I was very young when I saw that match, and now I have a daughter
 And I am so happy I saw that as a young man
" And one of those young men, at 12 years old, was President Obama
 And he actually told me that when I met him, he said: "You don't realize it, but I saw that match at 12
 And now I have two daughters, and it has made a difference in how I raise them
" So both men and women got a lot out of it, but different things
 And now there are generations -- at least one or two -- who have experienced the equality that Title IX and other fights along the way made possible
 They got to play team sports in a way they hadn't before
 So you had a legacy already built in terms of being an athlete, a legacy of the work you did to lobby for equal pay for women athletes and the Women's Sports Foundation
 What now are you looking to accomplish with The Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative?
 I think it goes back to an epiphany I had at 12
 At 11, I wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world, and a friend had asked me to play and I said, "What's that?" Tennis was not in my family -- basketball was, other sports
 Fast forward to 12 years old,
and I'm finally starting to play in tournaments where you get a ranking at the end of the year
 So I was daydreaming at the Los Angeles Tennis Club, and I started thinking about my sport and how tiny it was, but also that everybody who played wore white shoes, white clothes, played with white balls -- everybody who played was white
 And I said to myself, at 12 years old, "Where is everyone else?" And that just kept sticking in my brain
 And that moment, I promised myself I'd fight for equal rights and opportunities for boys and girls, men and women, the rest of my life
 And that tennis, if I was fortunate enough to become number one -- and I knew, being a girl, it would be harder to have influence, already at that age -- that I had this platform
 And I thought, "You know what? I've been given an opportunity that very few people have had
" I didn't know if I was going to make it -- this was only 12
 I sure wanted it, but making it is a whole other discussion
 I just remember I promised myself, and I really try to keep my word
And, unfortunately, women have had less
 And we are considered less
 And so my attentions, where did they have to go? It was just 
 you have to
 And learn to stick up for yourself, hear your own voice
 You hear the same words keep coming out all the time, and I got really lucky because I had an education
 You look at Pat, you look at other leaders, you look at these speakers, look at yourself, because everyone -- everyone -- can do something extraordinary
 Every single person
 And your story, Billie, has inspired so many women everywhere
 Because one thing we hear a lot about is women taking their voice, working to find their way into leadership positions
 But what you're talking about is even bigger than that
 It's inclusive leadership
 And this is a generation that has grown up thinking more inclusively --
 It's simply amazing what's possible because of it
 But the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative is really about the workforce mostly, and trying to change it, so people can actually go to work and be their authentic selves
Because most of us have two jobs: One, to fit in -- I'll give you a perfect example
 An African American woman gets up an hour earlier to go to work, straightens her hair in the bathroom, goes to the bathroom probably four, five, six times a day to keep straightening her hair, to keep making sure she fits in
 So she's working two jobs
 She's got this other job, whatever that may be, but she's also trying to fit in
 Or this poor man who kept his diploma -- he went to University of Michigan, but he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster, ever -- just would not mention it
 So he made sure they saw he was well-educated
 It just goes on and on
 So my wish for everyone is to be able to be their authentic self 24/7, that would be the ultimate
 And we catch ourselves -- I mean, I catch myself to this day
a little uncomfortable, a little surge in my gut, feeling not totally comfortable in my own skin
 So, I think you have to ask yourself -- I want people to be themselves, whatever that is, just let it be
 And the first research the Leadership Initiative did showed that, that these examples you just used -- that many of us have the problem of being authentic
 But what you've just looked at is this millennial generation, who have benefited from all these equal opportunities -- which may not be equal but exist everywhere --
 First of all, I'm really lucky
 Partnership with Teneo, a strategic company that's amazing
 That's really the reason I'm able to do this
 I've had two times in my life where I've actually had men really behind me with power
 And then Deloitte
 The one thing I wanted was data -- facts
And what do the millennials feel? Well, they feel a lot, but what they're so fantastic about is -- you know, our generation was like, "Oh, we're going to get representation
" So if you walk into a room, you see everybody represented
 That's not good enough anymore, which is so good! So the millennials are fantastic; they want connection, engagement
 They're problem-solvers, and of course, you've got the information at your fingertips, compared to when I was growing up
 Well, in 2025, 75 percent of the global workforce is going to be millennials
 I think they are going to help solve problems
 I think they have the wherewithal to do it
 I know they care a lot
 They have big ideas and they can make big things happen
 No, well, if we want to talk -- OK, I've been doing my little mini-survey
 I've been talking to the Boomers, who are their bosses, and I go, "What do you think about the millennials?" And I'm pretty excited, like it's good, and they get this face --
"Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?"
I say, "Do you really think so? Because I do think they care about the environment and all these things
" And they go, "Oh, Billie, they cannot focus
"
They actually have proven
that the average focus for an 18-year-old is 37 seconds
They can't focus
 And they don't really care
 I just heard a story the other night: a woman owns a gallery and she has these workers
 She gets a text from one of the workers, like an intern, she's just starting -- she goes, "Oh, by the way, I'm going to be late because I'm at the hairdresser's
So she arrives, and this boss says, "What's going on?" And she says, "Oh, I was late, sorry, how's it going?" She says, "Well, guess what? I'd like you leave, you're finished
" She goes, "OK
"
 It's a fact
 With the Women's Sports Foundation being the advocates for Title IX still, because we're trying to keep protecting the law, because it's in a tenuous position always, so we really are concerned, and we do a lot of research
 But we really have to protect what Title IX stands for worldwide
 And do you know that every single lawsuit that girls, at least in sports, have gone up against -- whatever institutions -- has won? Title IX is there to protect us
 But we still have to get the hearts and minds -- the hearts and minds to match the legislation is huge
 So what gets you up every morning? What keeps you sustaining your work, sustaining the fight for equality, extending it, always exploring new areas, trying to find new ways 
 ?
 Well, I always drove my parents crazy because I was always the curious one
 I'm highly motivated
 My younger brother was a Major League Baseball player
 My poor parents did not care if we were any good
 And I think it's because of what I'm hearing today in TED talks
 I think to listen to these different women, to listen to different people, to listen to President Carter -- 90 years old, by the way, and he we was throwing these figures out that I would never -- I'd have to go, "Excuse me, wait a minute, I need to get a list out of these figures
" He was rattling off -- I mean, that's amazing, I'm sorry
 He's an amazing man
Congress is voting in June on same-sex marriage, so these are things that for some people are very hard to hear
 But always remember, every one of us is an individual, a human being with a beating heart, who cares and wants to live their authentic life
I think we all have an obligation to continue to keep moving the needle forward, always
 And these people have been so inspiring
 You out there listening, out there in the world, plus the people here -- every single person's an influencer
 Never, ever forget that
 Billie, you have been an inspiration for us
 Thanks, Pat!
Thanks, TED!
Thanks a lot!
Well, we all need a reason to wake up
I know you're too polite to ask, so I will tell you
One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and I were horsing around, and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train
 Somehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time
 We'd certainly done stupider things
 I scurried up the ladder on the back, and when I stood up, the electrical current entered my arm, blew down and out my feet, and that was that
 Would you believe that watch still works? Takes a licking!
My father wears it now in solidarity
That night began my formal relationship with death -- my death -- and it also began my long run as a patient
 It's a good word
 It means one who suffers
 So I guess we're all patients
Now, the American health care system has more than its fair share of dysfunction -- to match its brilliance, to be sure
 And believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcare really means well -- I mean, truly
 But we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often does not serve
Why? Well, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question, and it explains a lot: because healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center
 Which is to say, of course, it was badly designed
 And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life, where things are so distilled and concentrated
 There are no do-overs
My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation
 That is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying
 We have a monumental opportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die
So let's begin at the end
 For most people, the scariest thing about death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering
 It's a key distinction
 To get underneath this, it can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is, from suffering we can change
 The former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal, and to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow
 It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves
 They bring proportionality, like a cosmic right-sizing
 After my limbs were gone, that loss, for example, became fact, fixed -- necessarily part of my life, and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself
 It took me a while, but I learned it eventually
 Now, another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver -- human beings
 This, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens
 Yes, compassion -- literally, as we learned yesterday -- suffering together
 It serves no good purpose
 But the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up, well, we can change it
 How we die is indeed something we can affect
 Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day
 After all, our role as caregivers, as people who care, is to relieve suffering -- not add to the pile
True to the tenets of palliative care, I function as something of a reflective advocate, as much as prescribing physician
 Quick aside: palliative care -- a very important field but poorly understood -- while it includes, it is not limited to end of life care
 It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage
Now, let me introduce you to Frank
 Sort of makes this point
 I've been seeing Frank now for years
 We work on his bone pain and his fatigue, but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life -- really, about our lives
 In this way, Frank grieves
 In this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in, so that he's ready to take in the next moment
 Frank has always been an adventurer -- he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting -- and no fan of regret
 So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day, saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River
 Was this a good idea? With all the risks to his safety and his health, some would say no
 Many did, but he went for it, while he still could
So much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective
 After my accident, when I went back to college, I changed my major to art history
 Studying visual art, I figured I'd learn something about how to see -- a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing
 When one of our residents dies, the mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden, heading for the gate, we pause
 It takes a few minutes; it's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance
 Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting, much like this -- floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has
 Cleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away, and it all feels as though that person had never really existed
 Well-intended, of course, in the name of sterility, but hospitals tend to assault our senses, and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness -- anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic
 I revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them
 But we ask too much of our hospitals
 They are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for
 Beauty can be found anywhere
 And one night, it began to snow outside
 I remember my nurses complaining about driving through it
 And there was no window in my room, but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky
 Next day, one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me
 She brought it in to the unit
 I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand, and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin; the miracle of it all, the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water
 In that moment, just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me than whether I lived or died
 That little snowball packed all the inspiration I needed to both try to live and be OK if I did not
 In a hospital, that's a stolen moment
In my work over the years, I've known many people who were ready to go, ready to die
 Not because they had found some final peace or transcendence, but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become -- in a word, cut off, or ugly
 We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population
 Now is the time to create something new, something vital
 The alternative is just unacceptable
 And the key ingredients are known: policy, education and training, systems, bricks and mortar
 We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with
We know, for example, from research what's most important to people who are closer to death: comfort; feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love; existential peace; and a sense of wonderment and spirituality
Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years, we've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail
 She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS
 Well, guess what? She wants to start smoking again -- and French cigarettes, if you please
 Not out of some self-destructive bent, but to feel her lungs filled while she has them
 Or Kate -- she just wants to know her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed, his cold muzzle against her dry skin, instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins -- she's done that
 Sensuous, aesthetic gratification, where in a moment, in an instant, we are rewarded for just being
 But we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels: smell, a symbolic plane
 Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff happening under our roof, one of the most tried and true interventions we know of, is to bake cookies
 As long as we have our senses -- even just one -- we have at least the possibility of accessing what makes us feel human, connected
 Imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people living and dying with dementia
 Primal sensorial delights that say the things we don't have words for, impulses that make us stay present -- no need for a past or a future
So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue, then tending to dignity by way of the senses, by way of the body -- the aesthetic realm -- is design cue number two
 Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today; namely, we need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being, so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life more wonderful, rather than just less horrible
Here, this gets right at the distinction between a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care, and here is where caring becomes a creative, generative, even playful act
 "Play" may sound like a funny word here
 The need for shelter has given rise to architecture
 The need for cover, fashion
 And for being subjected to the clock, well, we invented music
 So, since dying is a necessary part of life, what might we create with this fact? By "play" I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying or that we mandate any particular way of dying
 There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move, and one way or another, we will all kneel there
 Rather, I am asking that we make space -- physical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out -- so that rather than just getting out of the way, aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end
 We can't solve for death
 I know some of you are working on this
Meanwhile, we can --
We can design towards it
 Parts of me died early on, and that's something we can all say one way or another
 I got to redesign my life around this fact, and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left, like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment, all the while melting away
 If we love such moments ferociously, then maybe we can learn to live well -- not in spite of death, but because of it
 Let death be what takes us, not lack of imagination
Thank you
Today I'm going to talk about work
 And the question I want to ask and answer is this: "Why do we work?" Why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning instead of living our lives just filled with bouncing from one TED-like adventure to another?
You may be asking yourselves that very question
 Now, I know of course, we have to make a living, but nobody in this room thinks that that's the answer to the question, "Why do we work?" For folks in this room, the work we do is challenging, it's engaging, it's stimulating, it's meaningful
So, we wouldn't work if we didn't get paid, but that's not why we do what we do
Now, I think this is totally obvious, but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me an incredibly profound question
 Why, if this is so obvious, why is it that for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet, the work they do has none of the characteristics that get us up and out of bed and off to the office every morning? How is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet to do work that is monotonous, meaningless and soul-deadening? Why is it that as capitalism developed, it created a mode of production, of goods and services, in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions that might come from work were eliminated? Workers who do this kind of work, whether they do it in factories, in call centers, or in fulfillment warehouses, do it for pay
 There is certainly no other earthly reason to do what they do except for pay
So the question is, "Why?" And here's the answer: the answer is technology
 Now, I know, I know -- yeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automation screws people, blah blah -- that's not what I mean
 I'm not talking about the kind of technology that has enveloped our lives, and that people come to TED to hear about
 I'm not talking about the technology of things, profound though that is
 I'm talking about another technology
 I'm talking about the technology of ideas
 I call it, "idea technology" -- how clever of me
 Science creates ways of understanding
 And in the social sciences, the ways of understanding that get created are ways of understanding ourselves
 And they have an enormous influence on how we think, what we aspire to, and how we act
If you think your poverty is God's will, you pray
 And if you think your poverty is the result of oppression and domination, then you rise up in revolt
 Whether your response to poverty is resignation or revolution, depends on how you understand the sources of your poverty
 This is the role that ideas play in shaping us as human beings, and this is why idea technology may be the most profoundly important technology that science gives us
 With ideas -- false ideas about human beings will not go away if people believe that they're true
 Because if people believe that they're true, they create ways of living and institutions that are consistent with these very false ideas
And that's how the industrial revolution created a factory system in which there was really nothing you could possibly get out of your day's work, except for the pay at the end of the day
 Because the father -- one of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith -- was convinced that human beings were by their very natures lazy, and wouldn't do anything unless you made it worth their while, and the way you made it worth their while was by incentivizing, by giving them rewards
 That was the only reason anyone ever did anything
 So we created a factory system consistent with that false view of human nature
 But once that system of production was in place, there was really no other way for people to operate, except in a way that was consistent with Adam Smith's vision
 So the work example is merely an example of how false ideas can create a circumstance that ends up making them true
It is not true that you "just can't get good help anymore
" It is true that you "can't get good help anymore" when you give people work to do that is demeaning and soulless
 And interestingly enough, Adam Smith -- the same guy who gave us this incredible invention of mass production, and division of labor -- understood this
 He said, of people who worked in assembly lines, of men who worked in assembly lines, he says: "He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become
" Now, notice the word here is "become
" "He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become
" Whether he intended it or not, what Adam Smith was telling us there, is that the very shape of the institution within which people work creates people who are fitted to the demands of that institution and deprives people of the opportunity to derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for granted
 But we do have to worry about the theories we have of human nature, because human nature will be changed by the theories we have that are designed to explain and help us understand human beings
The distinguished anthropologist, Clifford Geertz, said, years ago, that human beings are the "unfinished animals
" And what he meant by that was that it is only human nature to have a human nature that is very much the product of the society in which people live
 That human nature, that is to say our human nature, is much more created than it is discovered
 We design human nature by designing the institutions within which people live and work
And so you people -- pretty much the closest I ever get to being with masters of the universe -- you people should be asking yourself a question, as you go back home to run your organizations
 Just what kind of human nature do you want to help design?
Thanks
So I grew up in Orlando, Florida
 I was the son of an aerospace engineer
 I lived and breathed the Apollo program
 We either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the Cape
 I was impressed by, obviously, space and everything about it, but I was most impressed by the engineering that went into it
Behind me you see an amazing view, a picture that was taken from the International Space Station, and it shows a portion of our planet that's rarely seen and rarely studied and almost never explored
 That place is called the stratosphere
If you start on the planet and you go up and up and up, it gets colder and colder and colder, until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere, and then an amazing thing happens
 It gets colder at a much slower rate, and then it starts warming up, and then it gets warmer and warmer until the point where you can almost survive without any protection, about zero degrees, and then you end up getting colder and colder, and that's the top of the stratosphere
 It is one of the least accessible places on our planet
 Most often, when it's visited, it's by astronauts who are blazing up at it at probably several times the speed of sound, and they get a few seconds on the way up, and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in, on the way back in
But the question I asked is, is it possible to linger in the stratosphere? Is it possible to experience the stratosphere? Is it possible to explore the stratosphere?
I studied this using my favorite search engine for quite a while, about a year, and then I made a scary phone call
 It was a reference from a friend of mine to call Taber MacCallum from Paragon Space Development Corporation, and I asked him the question: is it possible to build a system to go into the stratosphere? And he said it was
 And after a period of about three years, we proceeded to do just that
 And on October 24 of last year, in this suit, I started on the ground, I went up in a balloon to 135,890 feet -- but who's counting?
Came back to Earth at speeds of up to 822 miles an hour
 And when I got to 10,000 feet, I opened a parachute and I landed
But this is really a science talk, and it's really an engineering talk, and what was amazing to me about that experience is that Taber said, yes, I think we can build a stratospheric suit, and more than that, come down tomorrow and let's talk to the team that formed the core of the group that actually built it
 And they did something which I think is important, which is they took the analogy of scuba diving
 You have everything that you could ever need
 You have a wetsuit
 You have visibility
 And that scuba is exactly this system, and we're going to launch it into the stratosphere
Three years later, this is what we have
 We've got an amazing suit that was made by ILC Dover
 ILC Dover was the company that made all of the Apollo suits and all of the extravehicular activity suits
 They had never sold a suit commercially, only to the government, but they sold one to me, which I am very grateful for
 Up here we have a parachute
 This was all about safety
 Everyone on the team knew that I have a wife and two small children -- 10 and 15 -- and I wanted to come back safely
 So there's a main parachute and a reserve parachute, and if I do nothing, the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device
 The suit itself can protect me from the cold
 This area in the front here has thermal protection
 It will actually heat water that will wrap around my body
 It has two redundant oxygen tanks
 Even if I was to get a quarter-inch hole in this suit, which is extremely unlikely, this system would still protect me from the low pressure of space
The main advantage of this system is weight and complexity
 And to do a capsule, there's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it, and it weighed about 3,000 pounds, and to raise 3,000 pounds to an altitude of 135,000 feet, which was my target altitude, it would have taken a balloon that was 45 to 50 million cubic feet
 Because I only weighed 500 pounds in this system, we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that, and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon
So with that, I want to take you to Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24
 We had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night
 And here's the suit
 Roswell's a great place to launch balloons, but it's a fantastic place to land under a parachute, especially when you're going to land 70 miles away from the place you started
 That's a helium truck in the background
 It's darkness
 I've already spent about an hour and a half pre-breathing
 And then here you see the suit going on
 It takes about an hour to get the suit on
 Astronauts get this really nice air-conditioned van to go to the launch pad, but I got a front loader
You can see the top
 That's where the helium is
 This is Dave clearing the airspace with the FAA for 15 miles
 And there we go
That's me waving with my left hand
 The reason I'm waving with my left hand is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway
My team forbade me from using my right hand
 So the trip up is beautiful
 It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse
It took two hours and seven minutes to go up, and it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes
 I was mostly trying to relax
 My heart rate was very low and I was trying not to use very much oxygen
 You can see how the fields in the background are relatively big at this point, and you can see me going up and up
It's interesting here, because if you look, I'm right over the airport, and I'm probably at 50,000 feet, but immediately I'm about to go into a stratospheric wind of over 120 miles an hour
 This is my flight director telling me that I had just gone higher than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon, and I was about 4,000 feet from release
 This is what it looks like
 You can see the darkness of space, the curvature of the Earth, the fragile planet below
 I'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now
 If anything goes wrong, I want to be ready
 And the main thing that I want to do here is to have a release and fall and stay completely stable
 Ground control
 Everyone ready? Five
 Four
 Three
 Two
 One
 And there you can see a drogue parachute, which I'll demonstrate in just a second, because that's really important
 There's the balloon going by a second time
 Right now, I'm about at the speed of sound
 There's nothing for me to tell it's the speed of sound, and very soon I will actually be as fast as I ever get, 822 miles an hour
 We lost the data
 So now I'm down low right now and you can basically see the parachute come out right there
 At this point, I'm very happy that there's a parachute out
 I thought I was the only one happy, but it turns out mission control was really happy as well
 The really nice thing about this is the moment I opened -- I had a close of friend of mine, Blikkies, my parachute guy
 He flew in another airplane, and he actually jumped out and landed right next to me
 This is my landing, but it's probably more properly called a crash
I hate to admit it, but this wasn't even close to my worst landing
 How are you doing?
 Hi there! Yay
So I want to tell you one thing that you might not have seen in that video, but one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release and what happens right after you release
 And what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute, and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me
 And I'll show you one of those right now
 If any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving, you probably used one of these
 But the problem with one of these things is right when you release, you're in zero gravity
 So it's very easy for this to just turn right around you
 And before you know it, you can be tangled up or spinning, or you can release this drogue late, in which case what happens is you're going down at 800 miles an hour, and this thing is going to destroy itself and not be very useful
 This pipe is so solid that you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around, and there's no way it will ever tangle with you
 And that prevented a very serious potential problem
 It was fantastic
 It's an engineer's dream to work with that group of people
 And I also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at Google, both for supporting me during this effort and also covering for me in the times that I was away
 But there's one other group I wanted to thank, and that's my family
 Yay
I would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology, and they weren't hearing any of it
 It was super hard on them, and the only reason that my wife put up with it was because I came back incredibly happy after each of the 250 tests, and she didn't want to take that away from me
 So I want to close with a story
" And so I listened to her idea and I said, "Katelyn, that's impossible
" And then I paused for a second, and I said, "Katelyn, it may not be impossible, it may not even be very, very hard, it's just that I don't know how to do it
"
Thank you
 You were something of a mathematical phenom
 And then the NSA came calling
 What was that about?
 Well the NSA -- that's the National Security Agency -- they didn't exactly come calling
 They had an operation at Princeton, where they hired mathematicians to attack secret codes and stuff like that
 And I knew that existed
 And they paid a lot
 So that was an irresistible pull
 I was
 Until you got fired
 Well, I did get fired
 Yes
 How come?
 Well, how come? I got fired because, well, the Vietnam War was on, and the boss of bosses in my organization was a big fan of the war and wrote a New York Times article, a magazine section cover story, about how we would win in Vietnam
 And I wrote a letter to the Times, which they published, saying not everyone who works for Maxwell Taylor, if anyone remembers that name, agrees with his views
 And I gave my own views 
 Oh, OK
 I can see that would --
 
 which were different from General Taylor's
 But in the end, nobody said anything
 But then, I was 29 years old at this time, and some kid came around and said he was a stringer from Newsweek magazine and he wanted to interview me and ask what I was doing about my views
 And I told him, "I'm doing mostly mathematics now, and when the war is over, then I'll do mostly their stuff
" Then I did the only intelligent thing I'd done that day -- I told my local boss that I gave that interview
 And he said, "What'd you say?" And I told him what I said
 And then he said, "I've got to call Taylor
" He called Taylor; that took 10 minutes
 I was fired five minutes after that
 But it wasn't bad
 It wasn't bad, because you went on to Stony Brook and stepped up your mathematical career
 You started working with this man here
 Who is this?
 Oh, [Shiing-Shen] Chern
 And I had some ideas, and I brought them to him and he liked them
 Together, we did this work which you can easily see up there
 There it is
 It led to you publishing a famous paper together
 Can you explain at all what that work was?
 No
 I mean, I could explain it to somebody
 But not many
 Not many people
 I think you told me it had something to do with spheres, so let's start here
 Well, it did, but I'll say about that work -- it did have something to do with that, but before we get to that -- that work was good mathematics
 I was very happy with it; so was Chern
 It even started a little sub-field that's now flourishing
 But, more interestingly, it happened to apply to physics, something we knew nothing about -- at least I knew nothing about physics, and I don't think Chern knew a heck of a lot
" Today, those things in there called Chern-Simons invariants have spread through a lot of physics
 And it was amazing
 It never occurred to me that it would be applied to physics
 But that's the thing about mathematics -- you never know where it's going to go
 So, we've been talking about how evolution shapes human minds that may or may not perceive the truth
 How can that happen?
 God knows
 But so often it comes back to save the day
 General relativity is an example
" So, you never know
 It is a mystery
 So, here's a mathematical piece of ingenuity
 Tell us about this
 Well, that's a ball -- it's a sphere, and it has a lattice around it -- you know, those squares
 What I'm going to show here was originally observed by [Leonhard] Euler, the great mathematician, in the 1700s
 That paper up there had its roots in this
 And if you look at the difference -- vertices minus edges plus faces -- you get two
 OK, well, two
 That's a good number
 Here's a different way of doing it -- these are triangles covering -- this has 12 vertices and 30 edges and 20 faces, 20 tiles
 And you take vertices minus edges plus faces -- you'll get two
 Here's a different shape
 This is a torus, or the surface of a doughnut: 16 vertices covered by these rectangles, 32 edges, 16 faces
 Vertices minus edges comes out to be zero
 It'll always come out to zero
 Every time you cover a torus with squares or triangles or anything like that, you're going to get zero
 And it's what's called a topological invariant
 It's pretty amazing
 No matter how you do it, you're always get the same answer
 So that was the first sort of thrust, from the mid-1700s, into a subject which is now called algebraic topology
 And your own work took an idea like this and moved it into higher-dimensional theory, higher-dimensional objects, and found new invariances?
 Yes
 Well, there were already higher-dimensional invariants: Pontryagin classes -- actually, there were Chern classes
 There were a bunch of these types of invariants
 I was struggling to work on one of them and model it sort of combinatorially, instead of the way it was typically done, and that led to this work and we uncovered some new things
 But if it wasn't for Mr
 Euler -- who wrote almost 70 volumes of mathematics and had 13 children, who he apparently would dandle on his knee while he was writing -- if it wasn't for Mr
 Euler, there wouldn't perhaps be these invariants
 OK, so that's at least given us a flavor of that amazing mind in there
 I think you probably didn't buy efficient market theory
 Somehow you found a way of creating astonishing returns over two decades
 So how on earth did you do this, Jim?
 I did it by assembling a wonderful group of people
 When I started doing trading, I had gotten a little tired of mathematics
 I was in my late 30s, I had a little money
 I made quite a lot of money with pure luck
 I mean, I think it was pure luck
 But in looking at the data, after a while I realized: it looks like there's some structure here
 And I hired a few mathematicians, and we started making some models -- just the kind of thing we did back at IDA [Institute for Defense Analyses]
 You design an algorithm, you test it out on a computer
 Does it work? Doesn't it work? And so on
 Can we take a look at this? Because here's a typical graph of some commodity
" How on earth could you trade looking at that, and see something that wasn't just random?
 In the old days -- this is kind of a graph from the old days, commodities or currencies had a tendency to trend
 Not necessarily the very light trend you see here, but trending in periods
 And if you decided, OK, I'm going to predict today, by the average move in the past 20 days -- maybe that would be a good prediction, and I'd make some money
 And in fact, years ago, such a system would work -- not beautifully, but it would work
 It's a very vestigial system
 So you would test a bunch of lengths of trends in time and see whether, for example, a 10-day trend or a 15-day trend was predictive of what happened next
 Sure, you would try all those things and see what worked best
 Because everyone could see that
 So, how did you stay ahead of the pack?
 We stayed ahead of the pack by finding other approaches -- shorter-term approaches to some extent
 The real thing was to gather a tremendous amount of data -- and we had to get it by hand in the early days
 We went down to the Federal Reserve and copied interest rate histories and stuff like that, because it didn't exist on computers
 We got a lot of data
 And very smart people -- that was the key
 I had hired a few -- some made money, some didn't make money
 I couldn't make a business out of that
 But I did know how to hire scientists, because I have some taste in that department
 So, that's what we did
 And gradually these models got better and better, and better and better
 You're credited with doing something remarkable at Renaissance, which is building this culture, this group of people, who weren't just hired guns who could be lured away by money
 Their motivation was doing exciting mathematics and science
 Well, I'd hoped that might be true
 They made a lot of money
 I can't say that no one came because of the money
 I think a lot of them came because of the money
 What role did machine learning play in all this?
 In a certain sense, what we did was machine learning
 It doesn't necessarily feed back on itself the way we did things
 But it worked
 I mean, you looked at everything, right? You looked at the weather, length of dresses, political opinion
 Yes, length of dresses we didn't try
 Well, everything
 Weather, annual reports, quarterly reports, historic data itself, volumes, you name it
 Whatever there is
 We take in terabytes of data a day
 And store it away and massage it and get it ready for analysis
 You're looking for anomalies
 You're looking for -- like you said, the efficient market hypothesis is not correct
 But any one anomaly might be just a random thing
 So, is the secret here to just look at multiple strange anomalies, and see when they align?
 Any one anomaly might be a random thing; however, if you have enough data you can tell that it's not
 But these things fade after a while; anomalies can get washed out
 A lot of people look at the hedge fund industry now and are sort of 
 shocked by it, by how much wealth is created there, and how much talent is going into it
 Do you have any worries about that industry, and perhaps the financial industry in general? Kind of being on a runaway train that's -- I don't know -- helping increase inequality? How would you champion what's happening in the hedge fund industry?
 We've done dandy, but the hedge fund industry as a whole has not done so wonderfully
 So an awful lot of the wealth that's been created in the last -- let's say, five or six years -- has not been created by hedge funds
 People would ask me, "What's a hedge fund?" And I'd say, "One and 20
" Which means -- now it's two and 20 -- it's two percent fixed fee and 20 percent of profits
 Hedge funds are all different kinds of creatures
 Rumor has it you charge slightly higher fees than that
 Five and 44, that's what we charge
 Five and 44
 So five percent flat, 44 percent of upside
 You still made your investors spectacular amounts of money
 People got very mad: "How can you charge such high fees?" I said, "OK, you can withdraw
" But "How can I get more?" was what people were --
But at a certain point, as I think I told you, we bought out all the investors because there's a capacity to the fund
 But should we worry about the hedge fund industry attracting too much of the world's great mathematical and other talent to work on that, as opposed to the many other problems in the world?
 Well, it's not just mathematical
 We hire astronomers and physicists and things like that
 It's still a pretty small industry
 And in fact, bringing science into the investing world has improved that world
 It's increased liquidity
 Spreads are narrower because people are trading that kind of stuff
 You're at a phase in your life now where you're actually investing, though, at the other end of the supply chain -- you're actually boosting mathematics across America
 Tell me about that
 I think '94
 I claim it was '93, she says it was '94, but it was one of those two years
We started the foundation, just as a convenient way to give charity
 And that's what we've done
 So that's what we do
 And so Math for America is basically investing in math teachers around the country, giving them some extra income, giving them support and coaching
 And really trying to make that more effective and make that a calling to which teachers can aspire
 Yeah -- instead of beating up the bad teachers, which has created morale problems all through the educational community, in particular in math and science, we focus on celebrating the good ones and giving them status
 Yeah, we give them extra money, 15,000 dollars a year
 We have 800 math and science teachers in New York City in public schools today, as part of a core
 There's a great morale among them
 They're staying in the field
 Next year, it'll be 1,000 and that'll be 10 percent of the math and science teachers in New York [City] public schools
 Jim, here's another project that you've supported philanthropically: Research into origins of life, I guess
 What are we looking at here? JS: Well, I'll save that for a second
 And then I'll tell you what you're looking at
 Origins of life is a fascinating question
 So what's pictured there is a star in formation
 Don't ask me how, but they're created
 And it takes them about a million years to settle out
 So, in steady state, there are about two million stars in formation at any time
 And there's all this crap sort of circling around it, dust and stuff
 And it'll form probably a solar system, or whatever it forms
 Molecules not just like methane, but formaldehyde and cyanide -- things that are the building blocks -- the seeds, if you will -- of life
 So, that may be typical
 And it may be typical that planets around the universe start off with some of these basic building blocks
 Now does that mean there's going to be life all around? Maybe
 But it's a question of how tortuous this path is from those frail beginnings, those seeds, all the way to life
 And most of those seeds will fall on fallow planets
 So for you, personally, finding an answer to this question of where we came from, of how did this thing happen, that is something you would love to see
 Would love to see
 And like to know -- if that path is tortuous enough, and so improbable, that no matter what you start with, we could be a singularity
 But on the other hand, given all this organic dust that's floating around, we could have lots of friends out there
 It'd be great to know
 Jim, a couple of years ago, I got the chance to speak with Elon Musk, and I asked him the secret of his success, and he said taking physics seriously was it
 Listening to you, what I hear you saying is taking math seriously, that has infused your whole life
 It's made you an absolute fortune, and now it's allowing you to invest in the futures of thousands and thousands of kids across America and elsewhere
 Could it be that science actually works? That math actually works?
 Math certainly works
 But this has been fun
 Working with Marilyn and giving it away has been very enjoyable
 I just find it -- it's an inspirational thought to me, that by taking knowledge seriously, so much more can come from it
 So thank you for your amazing life, and for coming here to TED
Thank you
Jim Simons!
If you want to buy high-quality, low-price cocaine, there really is only one place to go, and that is the dark net anonymous markets
Now, you can't get to these sites with a normal browser -- Chrome or Firefox -- because they're on this hidden part of the Internet, known as Tor hidden services, where URLs are a string of meaningless numbers and letters that end in 
onion, and which you access with a special browser called the Tor browser
Now, the Tor browser was originally a U
S
 Naval intelligence project
 It then became open source, and it allows anybody to browse the net without giving away their location
 And because of this fiendishly clever encryption system, the 20 or 30 -- we don't know exactly -- thousand sites that operate there are incredibly difficult to shut down
Little wonder, then, that it's a natural place to go for anybody with something to hide, and that something, of course, need not be illegal
 On the dark net, you will find whistle-blower sites, The New Yorker
 You will find libraries of pirated books
 But you'll also find the drugs markets, illegal pornography, commercial hacking services, and much more besides
 Now, the dark net is one of the most interesting, exciting places anywhere on the net
 And the reason is, because although innovation, of course, takes place in big businesses, takes place in world-class universities, it also takes place in the fringes, because those on the fringes -- the pariahs, the outcasts -- they're often the most creative, because they have to be
 In this part of the Internet, you will not find a single lolcat, a single pop-up advert anywhere
 And that's one of the reasons why I think many of you here will be on the dark net fairly soon
Not that I'm suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high-quality narcotics
Bear with me
 The first thing you will notice on signing up to one of these sites is how familiar it looks
 Every single product -- thousands of products -- has a glossy, high-res image, a detailed product description, a price
 There's a "Proceed to checkout" icon
Incredible
 That's important
 Something far simpler than that
 It's the user reviews
You see, every single vendor on these sites uses a pseudonym, naturally enough, but they keep the same pseudonym to build up a reputation
 And because it's easy for the buyer to change allegiance whenever they want, the only way of trusting a vendor is if they have a good history of positive feedback from other users of the site
 Prices tend to go down, product quality tends to go up, and the vendors are attentive, they're polite, they're consumer-centric, offering you all manner of special deals, one-offs, buy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery, to keep you happy
I spoke to Drugsheaven
 Drugsheaven was offering excellent and consistent marijuana at a reasonable price
 He had a very generous refund policy, detailed T's and C's, and good shipping times
 "I'm new here
 Do you mind if I buy just one gram of marijuana?"
A couple of hours later, I get a reply
 They always reply
 I would, too, if I were you
"
"So no problem if you'd like to start with just one gram
 I do hope we can do business together
 Best wishes, Drugsheaven
"
I don't know why he had a posh English accent, but I assume he did
Now, this kind of consumer-centric attitude is the reason why, when I reviewed 120,000 pieces of feedback that had been left on one of these sites over a three-month period, 95 percent of them were five out of five
 The customer, you see, is king
 But what does that mean? Well, on the one hand, that means there are more drugs, more available, more easily, to more people
 And by my reckoning, that is not a good thing
 But, on the other hand, if you are going to take drugs, you have a reasonably good way of guaranteeing a certain level of purity and quality, which is incredibly important if you're taking drugs
 And you can do so from the comfort of your own home, without the risks associated with buying on the streets
Now, as I said, you've got to be creative and innovative to survive in this marketplace
Let's take the payment system
 You don't pay with your credit card, of course -- that would lead directly back to you
 So you use the crypto-currency bitcoin, which is easily exchanged for real-world currencies and gives quite a high degree of anonymity to its users
 The community came up with a solution, called multi-signature escrow payments
 So on purchasing my item, I would send my bitcoin to a neutral, secure third digital wallet
 The vendor, who would see that I'd sent it, would be confident that they could then send the product to me, and then when I received it, at least two of the three people engaged in the transaction -- vendor, buyer, site administrator -- would have to sign the transaction off with a unique digital signature, and then the money would be transferred
Brilliant! Elegant
 It works
 So if you're clever, you can try and work out who's behind them
 So they came up with a tumbling service
 Hundreds of people send their bitcoin into one address, they're tumbled and jumbled up, and then the right amount is sent on to the right recipients, but they're different bitcoins: micro-laundering systems
Interested in what drugs are trending right now on the dark net markets? Check Grams, the search engine
 You can even buy some advertising space
Are you an ethical consumer worried about what the drugs industry is doing? Yeah
 One vendor will offer you fair trade organic cocaine
That's not being sourced from Colombian druglords, but Guatemalan farmers
 They even promised to reinvest 20 percent of any profits into local education programs
There's even a mystery shopper
Now, whatever you think about the morality of these sites -- and I submit that it's not actually an easy question -- the creation of functioning, competitive, anonymous markets, where nobody knows who anybody else is, constantly at risk of being shut down by the authorities, is a staggering achievement, a phenomenal achievement
 And it's that kind of innovation that's why those on the fringes are often the harbingers of what is to come
It's easy to forget that because of its short life, the Internet has actually changed many times over the last 30 years or so
 It started in the '70s as a military project, morphed in the 1980s to an academic network, co-opted by commercial companies in the '90s, and then invaded by all of us via social media in the noughties, but I think it's going to change again
 And I think things like the dark net markets -- creative, secure, difficult to censor -- I think that's the future
And the reason it's the future is because we're all worried about our privacy
 Surveys consistently show concerns about privacy
 The more time we spend online, the more we worry about them, and those surveys show our worries are growing
 We're worried about what happens to our data
 We're worried about who might be watching us
Since the revelations from Edward Snowden, there's been a huge increase in the number of people using various privacy-enhancing tools
 There are now between two and three million daily users of the Tor browser, the majority of which use is perfectly legitimate, sometimes even mundane
 And there are hundreds of activists around the world working on techniques and tools to keep you private online -- default encrypted messaging services
 We use it for everything from Skype to the search for extraterrestrial life
 But you add distributed computing and powerful encryption -- that's very, very hard to censor and control
 Another called MaidSafe works on similar principles
 Another called Twister, and so on and so on
And here's the thing -- the more of us join, the more interesting those sites become, and then the more of us join, and so on
In fact, it's already happening
 The dark net is no longer a den for dealers and a hideout for whistle-blowers
 It's already going mainstream
 Just recently, the musician Aphex Twin released his album as a dark net site
 Facebook has started a dark net site
 A group of London architects have opened a dark net site for people worried about regeneration projects
 Yes, the dark net is going mainstream, and I predict that fairly soon, every social media company, every major news outlet, and therefore most of you in this audience, will be using the dark net, too
So the Internet is about to get more interesting, more exciting, more innovative, more terrible, more destructive
 It's good news if you care about freedom
 It's good news if you care about democracy
 It's also good news if you want to browse for illegal pornography and if you want to buy and sell drugs with impunity
 Neither entirely dark, nor entirely light
I will always remember the first time I met the girl in the blue uniform
 I was eight at the time, living in the village with my grandmother, who was raising me and other children
 Famine had hit my country of Zimbabwe, and we just didn't have enough to eat
 We were hungry
 And that's when the girl in the blue uniform came to my village with the United Nations to feed the children
Two years later, famine hit my country for the second time
 My grandmother had no choice but to send me to the city to live with an aunt I had never met before
 So at the age of 10, I found myself in school for the very first time
 And there, at the city school, I would experience what it was to be unequal
 You see, in the village, we were all equal
 But in the eyes and the minds of the other kids, I was not their equal
 I couldn't speak English, and I was way behind in terms of reading and writing
 But this feeling of inequality would get even more complex
 Suddenly, I had much more than the rest of my village
 And in their eyes, I was no longer their equal
I felt guilty
 But I thought about the girl in the blue uniform, and I remember thinking, "That's who I want to be -- someone like her, someone who uplifts other people
" This childhood experience led me to the United Nations, and to my current role with UN Women, where we are addressing one of the greatest inequalities that affects more than half of the world's population -- women and girls
Today, I want to share with you a simple idea that seeks to uplift all of us together
 Eight months ago, under the visionary leadership of Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, head of UN Women, we launched a groundbreaking initiative called HeForShe, inviting men and boys from around the world to stand in solidarity with each other and with women, to create a shared vision for gender equality
 This is an invitation for those who believe in equality for women and men, and those who don't yet know that they believe
The initiative is based on a simple idea: that what we share is much more powerful than what divides us
 We all feel the same things
 We all want the same things, even when those things sometimes remain unspoken
 HeForShe is about uplifting all of us, women and men together
 It's moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality
 Now imagine that women are represented here, and men are represented here
2 billion men, one man at a time, across that line, so that ultimately, men can stand alongside women and be on the right side of history, making gender equality a reality in the 21st century
However, engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial
 Why invite men? They are the problem
 In just three days, more than 100,000 men had signed up and committed to be agents of change for equality
 Within that first week, at least one man in every single country in the world stood up to be counted, and within that same week, HeForShe created more than 1
2 billion conversations on social media
 And that's when the emails started pouring in, sometimes as many as a thousand a day
 We heard from a man out of Zimbabwe, who, after hearing about HeForShe, created a "husband school
"
He literally went around his village, hand-picking all of the men that were abusive to their partners, and committed to turn them into better husbands and fathers
 In Pune, India, a youth advocate organized an innovative bicycle rally, mobilizing 700 cyclists to share the HeForShe messages within their own community
In another impact story, a man sent a very personal note of something that had happened in his own community
 He wrote, "Dear Madam, I have lived all of my life next door to a man who continuously beats up his wife
 Within a few hours, I heard the woman cry again next door, but for the first time, I didn't just sit there
 I felt compelled to do something, so I went over and I confronted the husband
 Thank you for giving me a voice
"
Personal impact stories such as these show that we are tapping into something within men, but getting to a world where women and men are equal is not just a matter of bringing men to the cause
 We want concrete, systematic, structural change that can equalize the political, economic and social realities for women and men
 We are asking men to make concrete actions, calling them to intervene at a personal level, to change their behavior
 We are calling upon governments, businesses, universities, to change their policies
 We want male leaders to become role models and change agents within their own institutions
 In a few early success stories, a leading French hospitality company, Accor, has committed to eliminate the pay gap for all of its 180,000 employees by 2020
The government of Sweden, under its current feminist government, has committed to close both the employment and the pay gap for all of its citizens within the current electoral term
 In Japan, the University of Nagoya is building, as part of their HeForShe commitments, what will become one of Japan's leading gender-research centers
Now, eight months later, a movement is building
 In fact, one in 20 men in Iceland has joined the movement
 The rallying call of our passionate goodwill ambassador, Emma Watson, has garnered more than five billion media impressions, mobilizing hundreds and thousands of students around the world to create more than a hundred HeForShe student associations
 Einstein once said, "A human being is part of the whole 
 but he experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separate from the rest 
 This delusion is a kind of prison for us 
 Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion
"
If women and men are part of a greater whole, as Einstein suggests, it is my hope that HeForShe can help free us to realize that it is not our gender that defines us, but ultimately, our shared humanity
 HeForShe is tapping into women's and men's dreams, the dreams that we have for ourselves, and the dreams that we have for our families, our children, friends, communities
So that's what it is about
 HeForShe is about uplifting all of us together
Thank you
When I was 14 years old, I was interested in science -- fascinated by it, excited to learn about it
 And I had a high school science teacher who would say to the class, "The girls don't have to listen to this
"
Encouraging, yes
I chose not to listen -- but to that statement alone
So let me take you to the Andes mountains in Chile, 500 kilometers, 300 miles northeast of Santiago
 It's very remote, it's very dry and it's very beautiful
 And there's not much there
 There are condors, there are tarantulas, and at night, when the light dims, it reveals one of the darkest skies on Earth
And our ancestors, for as long as there's been recorded history, have looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence
 And we're no exception, our generation
 The only difficulty is that the night sky now is blocked by the glare of city lights
 So telescopes are our window to the cosmos
It's no exaggeration to say that the Southern Hemisphere is going to be the future of astronomy for the 21st century
 We have an array of existing telescopes already, in the Andes mountains in Chile, and that's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability
 There will be two international groups that are going to be building giant telescopes, sensitive to optical radiation, as our eyes are
 There will be a survey telescope that will be scanning the sky every few nights
 There will be radio telescopes, sensitive to long-wavelength radio radiation
 And then there will be telescopes in space
For the last decade, I've been leading a group -- a consortium -- international group, to build what will be, when it's finished, the largest optical telescope in existence
 It's called the Giant Magellan Telescope, or GMT
 This telescope is going to have mirrors that are 8
4 meters in diameter -- each of the mirrors
 That's almost 27 feet
 So it dwarfs this stage -- maybe out to the fourth row in this audience
 Each of the seven mirrors in this telescope will be almost 27 feet in diameter
 Together, the seven mirrors in this telescope will comprise 80 feet in diameter
 So, essentially the size of this entire auditorium
 The whole telescope will stand about 43 meters high, and again, being in Rio, some of you have been to see the statue of the giant Christ
 The scale is comparable in height; in fact, it's smaller than this telescope will be
 It's comparable to the size of the Statue of Liberty
 And it's going to be housed in an enclosure that's 22 stories -- 60 meters high
 But it's an unusual building to protect this telescope
 It will have open windows to the sky, be able to point and look at the sky, and it will actually rotate on a base -- 2,000 tons of rotating building
The Giant Magellan Telescope will have 10 times the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope
 It will be 20 million times more sensitive than the human eye
 And it may, for the first time ever, be capable of finding life on planets outside of our solar system
 It's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe -- literally, the dawn of the cosmos
 The cosmic dawn
 It's a telescope that's going to allow us to peer back, witness galaxies as they were when they were actually assembling, the first black holes in the universe, the first galaxies
Now, for thousands of years, we have been studying the cosmos, we've been wondering about our place in the universe
 The ancient Greeks told us that the Earth was the center of the universe
 Five hundred years ago, Copernicus displaced the Earth, and put the Sun at the heart of the cosmos
 We've learned in the 20th century that the universe is expanding and that our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion
 We know now that the universe is made of about 100 billion galaxies that are visible to us, and each one of those galaxies has 100 billion stars within it
So we're looking now at the deepest image of the cosmos that's ever been taken
 It was taken using the Hubble Space Telescope, and by pointing the telescope at what was previously a blank region of sky, before the launch of Hubble
 And if you can imagine this tiny area, it's only one-fiftieth of the size of the full moon
 So, if you can imagine the full moon
 And there are now 10,000 galaxies visible within that image
 And the faintness of those images and the tiny size is only a result of the fact that those galaxies are so far away, the vast distances
 And each of those galaxies may contain within it a few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars
 Telescopes are like time machines
 So the farther back we look in space, the further back we see in time
 And they're like light buckets -- literally, they collect light
 So larger the bucket, the larger the mirror we have, the more light we can see, and the farther back we can view
So, we've learned in the last century that there are exotic objects in the universe -- black holes
 We've even learned that there's dark matter and dark energy that we can't see
 So you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter
 Not all audiences get that
So the way we infer the presence of dark matter -- we can't see it -- but there's an unmistakable tug, due to gravity
 We now can look out, we see this sea of galaxies in a universe that's expanding
What I do myself is to measure the expansion of the universe, and one of the projects that I carried out in the 1990s used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure how fast the universe is expanding
 We can now trace back to 14 billion years
 We've learned over time that stars have individual histories; that is, they have birth, they have middle ages and some of them even have dramatic deaths
 So the embers from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see, most of which turn out to have planets going around them
 These are called exoplanets
 And until 1995, we didn't even know the existence of any other planets, other than going around our own sun
 But now, there are almost 2,000 other planets orbiting other stars that we can now detect, measure masses for
 And there are 4,000 -- and still counting -- other candidates for planets orbiting other stars
 There are Jupiter-like planets that are hot, there are other planets that are icy, there are water worlds and there are rocky planets like the Earth, so-called "super-Earths," and there have even been planets that have been speculated diamond worlds
So we know there's at least one planet, our own Earth, in which there is life
 We've even found planets that are orbiting two stars
 That's no longer the province of science fiction
 So around our own planet, we know there's life, we've developed a complex life, we now can question our own origins
 And given all that we've discovered, the overwhelming numbers now suggest that there may be millions, perhaps -- maybe even hundreds of millions -- of other [planets] that are close enough -- just the right distance from their stars that they're orbiting -- to have the existence of liquid water and maybe could potentially support life
 So we marvel now at those odds, the overwhelming odds, and the amazing thing is that within the next decade, the GMT may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets, and determine whether or not they have the potential for life
 It includes Australia, South Korea, and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio, that the newest partner in our telescope is Brazil
It also includes a number of institutions across the United States, including Harvard University, the Smithsonian and the Carnegie Institutions, and the Universities of Arizona, Chicago, Texas-Austin and Texas A&M University
 It also involves Chile
So, the making of the mirrors in this telescope is also fascinating in its own right
 Take chunks of glass, melt them in a furnace that is itself rotating
 This happens underneath the football stadium at the University of Arizona
 It's tucked away under 52,000 seats
 Nobody know it's happening
 And there's essentially a rotating cauldron
 The mirrors are cast and they're cooled very slowly, and then they're polished to an exquisite precision
 And so, if you think about the precision of these mirrors, the bumps on the mirror, over the entire 27 feet, amount to less than one-millionth of an inch
 So, can you visualize that? Ow!
That's one five-thousandths of the width of one of my hairs, over this entire 27 feet
 It's a spectacular achievement
 It's what allows us to have the precision that we will have
So, what does that precision buy us? So the GMT, if you can imagine -- if I were to hold up a coin, which I just happen to have, and I look at the face of that coin, I can see from here the writing on the coin; I can see the face on that coin
 My guess that even in the front row, you can't see that
 But if we were to turn the Giant Magellan Telescope, all 80-feet diameter that we see in this auditorium, and point it 200 miles away, if I were standing in São Paulo, we could resolve the face of this coin
 That's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope
If an astronaut went up to the Moon, a quarter of a million miles away, and lit a candle -- a single candle -- then we would be able to detect it, using the GMT
 Quite extraordinary
This is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy
 "Nearby" is astronomical, it's all relative
 So look at those four bright objects, and now lets compare it with a camera on the Hubble Space Telescope
 You can see faint detail that starts to come through
 So, keep your eyes on those bright images again
 Extraordinary precision
So, where are we? We have now leveled the top of the mountaintop in Chile
 We blasted that off
 We've tested and polished the first mirror
 We've cast the second and the third mirrors
 And we're about to cast the fourth mirror
 We had a series of reviews this year, international panels that came in and reviewed us, and said, "You're ready to go to construction
" And so we plan on building this telescope with the first four mirrors
 We want to get on the air quickly, and be taking science data -- what we astronomers call "first light," in 2021
So we're now poised to look back at the distant universe, the cosmic dawn
But for me, one of the most exciting things about building the GMT is the opportunity to actually discover something that we don't know about -- that we can't even imagine at this point, something completely new
 And my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities, that many young women and men will be inspired to reach for the stars
Thank you very much
 Obrigado
 Stay with me, because I have a question for you
 Is it about cooperation and complementarity, or about competition? I know there's competition in terms of funding, but what about the science?
 So, they're very complementary
 You're right about the funding, we compete; but scientifically, it's very complementary
 Wendy, thank you very much for coming to TEDGlobal
 Thank you
Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize [winner] in economics, once wrote: "Productivity is not everything, but in the long run, it is almost everything
"
 There are not that many things on earth that are "almost everything
" Productivity is the principal driver of the prosperity of a society
 So we have a problem
 In the largest European economies, productivity used to grow five percent per annum in the '50s, '60s, early '70s
 From '73 to '83: three percent per annum
 Since 1995: less than one percent per annum
 The same profile in Japan
 The same profile in the US, despite a momentary rebound 15 years ago, and despite all the technological innovations around us: the Internet, the information, the new information and communication technologies
When productivity grows three percent per annum, you double the standard of living every generation
 Every generation is twice as well-off as its parents'
 When it grows one percent per annum, it takes three generations to double the standard of living
 And in this process, many people will be less well-off than their parents
 They will have less of everything: smaller roofs, or perhaps no roof at all, less access to education, to vitamins, to antibiotics, to vaccination -- to everything
 Think of all the problems that we're facing at the moment
 All
 Chances are that they are rooted in the productivity crisis
Why this crisis? Because the basic tenets about efficiency -- effectiveness in organizations, in management -- have become counterproductive for human efforts
 Take the holy trinity of efficiency: clarity, measurement, accountability
 They make human efforts derail
There are two ways to look at it, to prove it
 But the full math version takes a little while, so there is another one
 It is to look at a relay race
 This is what we will do today
 It's a bit more animated, more visual and also faster -- it's a race
 Hopefully, it's faster
World championship final -- women
 Eight teams in the final
 The fastest team is the US team
 They have the fastest women on earth
based on their best performances in the 100-meter race, if you add the individual times of the US runners, they arrive at the finish line 3
 And this year, the US team is in great shape
 Based on their best performance this year, they arrive 6
 We are going to look at the race
 At some point you will see, towards the end, that Torri Edwards, the fourth US runner, is ahead
 Not surprising -- this year she got the gold medal in the 100-meter race
 And by the way, Chryste Gaines, the second runner in the US team, is the fastest woman on earth
 Where are the two fastest? On the US team
 And the two other runners on the US team are not bad, either
So clearly, the US team has won the war for talent
 But behind, the average team is trying to catch up
 Let's watch the race
 By the way, I hope you appreciate the deep historical research I did to make the French look good
But let's not exaggerate -- it's not archeology, either
But why? Because of cooperation
 When you hear this sentence: "Thanks to cooperation, the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts
" This is not poetry; this is not philosophy
 This is math
 Those who carry the baton are slower, but their baton is faster
 Miracle of cooperation: it multiplies energy, intelligence in human efforts
 It is the essence of human efforts: how we work together, how each effort contributes to the efforts of others
 With cooperation, we can do more with less
Now, what happens to cooperation when the holy grail -- the holy trinity, even -- of clarity, measurement, accountability -- appears?
Clarity
 Management reports are full of complaints about the lack of clarity
 Compliance audits, consultants' diagnostics
 It is as though the runners on the team were saying, "Let's be clear -- where does my role really start and end? Am I supposed to run for 95 meters, 96, 97
?" It's important, let's be clear
 If you say 97, after 97 meters, people will drop the baton, whether there is someone to take it or not
Accountability
 We are constantly trying to put accountability in someone's hands
 Who is accountable for this process? We need somebody accountable for this process
 So in the relay race, since passing the baton is so important, then we need somebody clearly accountable for passing the baton
 So between each runner, now we will have a new dedicated athlete, clearly dedicated to taking the baton from one runner, and passing it to the next runner
 Well, will we, in that case, win the race? That I don't know, but for sure, we would have a clear interface, a clear line of accountability
 We will know who to blame
 But we'll never win the race
 If you think about it, we pay more attention to knowing who to blame in case we fail, than to creating the conditions to succeed
 All the human intelligence put in organization design -- urban structures, processing systems -- what is the real goal? To have somebody guilty in case they fail
 We are creating organizations able to fail, but in a compliant way, with somebody clearly accountable when we fail
 And we are quite effective at that -- failing
Measurement
 What gets measured gets done
 Look, to pass the baton, you have to do it at the right time, in the right hand, at the right speed
 But to do that, you have to put energy in your arm
 This energy that is in your arm will not be in your legs
 It will come at the expense of your measurable speed
 You have to shout early enough to the next runner when you will pass the baton, to signal that you are arriving, so that the next runner can prepare, can anticipate
 And you have to shout loud
 But the blood, the energy that will be in your throat will not be in your legs
 Because you know, there are eight people shouting at the same time
 You cannot say, "Is it you?" Too late!
 Look at where she allocates her efforts, her energy, her attention
 Not all in her legs -- that would be great for her own speed -- but in also in her throat, arm, eye, brain
 And if we reward people on the basis of their measurable performance, they will put their energy, their attention, their blood in what can get measured -- in their legs
 And the baton will fall and slow down
To cooperate is not a super effort, it is how you allocate your effort
 It is to take a risk, because you sacrifice the ultimate protection granted by objectively measurable individual performance
 It is to make a super difference in the performance of others, with whom we are compared
 It takes being stupid to cooperate, then
 And people are not stupid; they don't cooperate
You know, clarity, accountability, measurement were OK when the world was simpler
 But business has become much more complex
 With my teams, we have measured the evolution of complexity in business
 And the more business gets complex, the more, in the name of clarity, accountability, measurement we multiply structures, processes, systems
You know, this drive for clarity and accountability triggers a counterproductive multiplication of interfaces, middle offices, coordinators that do not only mobilize people and resources, but that also add obstacles
 And the more complicated the organization, the more difficult it is to understand what is really happening
 So we need summaries, proxies, reports, key performance indicators, metrics
 So people put their energy in what can get measured, at the expense of cooperation
 And as performance deteriorates, we add even more structure, process, systems
 People spend their time in meetings, writing reports they have to do, undo and redo
 Based on our analysis, teams in these organizations spend between 40 and 80 percent of their time wasting their time, but working harder and harder, longer and longer, on less and less value-adding activities
Our organizations are wasting human intelligence
 When people don't cooperate, don't blame their mindsets, their mentalities, their personality -- look at the work situations
 Remove the interfaces, the middle offices -- all these complicated coordination structures
 Fuzziness overlaps
 Remove most of the quantitative metrics to assess performance
 Speed the "what
" Look at cooperation, the "how
" How did you pass the baton? Did you throw it, or did you pass it effectively? Am I putting my energy in what can get measured -- my legs, my speed -- or in passing the baton?
You, as leaders, as managers, are you making it individually useful for people to cooperate? The future of our organizations, our companies, our societies hinges on your answer to these questions
Thank you
Over a million people are killed each year in disasters
 Two and a half million people will be permanently disabled or displaced, and the communities will take 20 to 30 years to recover and billions of economic losses
If you can reduce the initial response by one day, you can reduce the overall recovery by a thousand days, or three years
 See how that works? If the initial responders can get in, save lives, mitigate whatever flooding danger there is, that means the other groups can get in to restore the water, the roads, the electricity, which means then the construction people, the insurance agents, all of them can get in to rebuild the houses, which then means you can restore the economy, and maybe even make it better and more resilient to the next disaster
 A major insurance company told me that if they can get a homeowner's claim processed one day earlier, it'll make a difference of six months in that person getting their home repaired
And that's why I do disaster robotics -- because robots can make a disaster go away faster
Now, you've already seen a couple of these
 These are two types of UAVs: a rotorcraft, or hummingbird; a fixed-wing, a hawk
 And they're used extensively since 2005 -- Hurricane Katrina
 Let me show you how this hummingbird, this rotorcraft, works
 Being able to see damage from angles you can't get from binoculars on the ground or from a satellite image, or anything flying at a higher angle
 But it's not just structural engineers and insurance people who need this
 You've got things like this fixed-wing, this hawk
 Now, this hawk can be used for geospatial surveys
 That's where you're pulling imagery together and getting 3D reconstruction
We used both of these at the Oso mudslides up in Washington State, because the big problem was geospatial and hydrological understanding of the disaster -- not the search and rescue
 The search and rescue teams had it under control and knew what they were doing
 The bigger problem was that river and mudslide might wipe them out and flood the responders
 And not only was it challenging to the responders and property damage, it's also putting at risk the future of salmon fishing along that part of Washington State
 So they needed to understand what was going on
 In seven hours, going from Arlington, driving from the Incident Command Post to the site, flying the UAVs, processing the data, driving back to Arlington command post -- seven hours
 We gave them in seven hours data that they could take only two to three days to get any other way -- and at higher resolution
 It's a game changer
And don't just think about the UAVs
 I mean, they are sexy -- but remember, 80 percent of the world's population lives by water, and that means our critical infrastructure is underwater -- the parts that we can't get to, like the bridges and things like that
 And that's why we have unmanned marine vehicles, one type of which you've already met, which is SARbot, a square dolphin
 It goes underwater and uses sonar
 Well, why are marine vehicles so important and why are they very, very important? They get overlooked
 Think about the Japanese tsunami -- 400 miles of coastland totally devastated, twice the amount of coastland devastated by Hurricane Katrina in the United States
 You're talking about your bridges, your pipelines, your ports -- wiped out
 And if you don't have a port, you don't have a way to get in enough relief supplies to support a population
 That was a huge problem at the Haiti earthquake
 So we need marine vehicles
Now, let's look at a viewpoint from the SARbot of what they were seeing
 We were working on a fishing port
 We were able to reopen that fishing port, using her sonar, in four hours
 They were going to miss the fall fishing season, which was the major economy for that part, which is kind of like their Cape Cod
 UMVs, very important
But you know, all the robots I've shown you have been small, and that's because robots don't do things that people do
 They go places people can't go
 Unmanned ground vehicles are particularly small, so Bujold --
Say hello to Bujold
Bujold was used extensively at the World Trade Center to go through Towers 1, 2 and 4
 You're climbing into the rubble, rappelling down, going deep in spaces
 And just to see the World Trade Center from Bujold's viewpoint, look at this
 You're talking about a disaster where you can't fit a person or a dog -- and it's on fire
 Robots don't replace people or dogs, or hummingbirds or hawks or dolphins
 They do things new
 They assist the responders, the experts, in new and innovative ways
The biggest problem is not making the robots smaller, though
 It's not making them more heat-resistant
 It's not making more sensors
So wouldn't it be great if we could have experts immediately access the robots without having to waste any time of driving to the site, so whoever's there, use their robots over the Internet
 Well, let's think about that
 Let's think about a chemical train derailment in a rural county
 What are the odds that the experts, your chemical engineer, your railroad transportation engineers, have been trained on whatever UAV that particular county happens to have? Probably, like, none
 So we're using these kinds of interfaces to allow people to use the robots without knowing what robot they're using, or even if they're using a robot or not
 What the robots give you, what they give the experts, is data
 who gets what data when? One thing to do is to ship all the information to everybody and let them sort it out
 Well, the problem with that is it overwhelms the networks, and worse yet, it overwhelms the cognitive abilities of each of the people trying to get that one nugget of information they need to make the decision that's going to make the difference
 So it's the data
Going back to the World Trade Center, we tried to solve that problem by just recording the data from Bujold only when she was deep in the rubble, because that's what the USAR team said they wanted
 What we didn't know at the time was that the civil engineers would have loved, needed the data as we recorded the box beams, the serial numbers, the locations, as we went into the rubble
 We lost valuable data
 So the challenge is getting all the data and getting it to the right people
Now, here's another reason
 We've learned that some buildings -- things like schools, hospitals, city halls -- get inspected four times by different agencies throughout the response phases
 Now, we're looking, if we can get the data from the robots to share, not only can we do things like compress that sequence of phases to shorten the response time, but now we can begin to do the response in parallel
 We can shorten it that way
So really, "disaster robotics" is a misnomer
 It's not about the robots
So my challenge to you: the next time you hear about a disaster, look for the robots
 They may be underground, they may be underwater, they may be in the sky, but they should be there
 Look for the robots, because robots are coming to the rescue
The child's symptoms begin with mild fever, headache, muscle pains, followed by vomiting and diarrhea, then bleeding from the mouth, nose and gums
 Death follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure
 It's an extreme form of dengue fever, a mosquito-born disease which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine, and kills 22,000 people each year
 That is actually twice the number of people that have been killed by Ebola in the nearly four decades that we've known about it
 As for measles, so much in the news recently, the death toll is actually tenfold higher
 Yet for the last year, it has been Ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear
Clearly, there is something deeply rooted about it, something which scares us and fascinates us more than other diseases
 Why? Because right now, we don't have any effective therapy or vaccine available
 We may have it someday
 So we rightfully fear Ebola, because it doesn't kill as many people as other diseases
 In fact, it's much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles
 We fear Ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can't treat it
 We fear the certain inevitability that comes with Ebola
 Ebola has this inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science
But wait a second, why is that? We've known about Ebola since 1976
 We've had ample opportunity to study it in the 24 outbreaks that have occurred
 And in fact, we've actually had vaccine candidates available now for more than a decade
 Why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now?
This goes to the fundamental problem we have with vaccine development for infectious diseases
 It goes something like this: The people most at risk for these diseases are also the ones least able to pay for vaccines
 It's simply too commercially risky
As for Ebola, there is absolutely no market at all, so the only reason we have two vaccines in late-stage clinical trials now, is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear
 Ebola was relatively ignored until September 11 and the anthrax attacks, when all of a sudden, people perceived Ebola as, potentially, a bioterrorism weapon
Why is it that the Ebola vaccine wasn't fully developed at this point? Well, partially, because it was really difficult -- or thought to be difficult -- to weaponize the virus, but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it
 And this is really the point
 The sad reality is, we develop vaccines not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people, but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines
 Vaccine development is expensive and complicated
 It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to take even a well-known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine
Fortunately for diseases like Ebola, there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers
 In that case, if we want vaccines, we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy
 We also need to do a better job at being able to figure out which are the diseases that most threaten us
 By creating capabilities within countries, we then create the ability for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens
 We have to stop waiting until we see evidence of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one
 So, for Ebola, the paranoid fear of an infectious disease, followed by a few cases transported to wealthy countries, led the global community to come together, and with the work of dedicated vaccine companies, we now have these: Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the Ebola countries --
and a pipeline of vaccines that are following behind
Every year, we spend billions of dollars, keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines permanently patrolling the oceans to protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen
 And make no mistake about it -- it's not a question of "if," but "when
" These bugs are going to continue to evolve and they're going to threaten the world
 So if we want to be able to prevent epidemics like Ebola, we need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development and in stockpile creation
 And we need to view this, then, as the ultimate deterrent -- something we make sure is available, but at the same time, praying we never have to use it
Thank you
I'd like to introduce you to an emerging area of science, one that is still speculative but hugely exciting, and certainly one that's growing very rapidly
 But it's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments -- in biochemistry labs, using spectroscopy -- have shown very clear, firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms that require quantum mechanics to explain them
Quantum biology brings together quantum physicists, biochemists, molecular biologists -- it's a very interdisciplinary field
 I come from quantum physics, so I'm a nuclear physicist
I've spent more than three decades trying to get my head around quantum mechanics
 One of the founders of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr, said, If you're not astonished by it, then you haven't understood it
 That's a good thing
 But it means I study the very smallest structures in the universe -- the building blocks of reality
 If we think about the scale of size, start with an everyday object like the tennis ball, and just go down orders of magnitude in size -- from the eye of a needle down to a cell, down to a bacterium, down to an enzyme -- you eventually reach the nano-world
Now, nanotechnology may be a term you've heard of
 A nanometer is a billionth of a meter
 My area is the atomic nucleus, which is the tiny dot inside an atom
 It's even smaller in scale
 This is the domain of quantum mechanics, and physicists and chemists have had a long time to try and get used to it
 They are very happy with their balls-and-sticks models of molecules
 And when they can't build them physically in the lab, nowadays, they have very powerful computers that will simulate a huge molecule
 This is a protein made up of 100,000 atoms
 It doesn't really require much in the way of quantum mechanics to explain it
 Quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s
 It is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas that explain the world of the very small
 And it's a world that's very different from our everyday world, made up of trillions of atoms
 It's a world built on probability and chance
 It's a fuzzy world
 It's a world of phantoms, where particles can also behave like spread-out waves
 After all, it gives us the rules that tell us how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules
 Organic chemistry, scaled up in complexity, gives us molecular biology, which of course leads to life itself
 So in a way, it's sort of not surprising
 It's almost trivial
 You say, "Well, of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics
" But so does everything else
 So does all inanimate matter, made up of trillions of atoms
 Because once you put together trillions of atoms, that quantum weirdness just dissolves away
 Quantum biology isn't about this
 Quantum biology isn't this obvious
 Of course quantum mechanics underpins life at some molecular level
 Quantum biology is about looking for the non-trivial -- the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics -- and to see if they do, indeed, play an important role in describing the processes of life
 This is the quantum skier
 He seems to be intact, he seems to be perfectly healthy, and yet, he seems to have gone around both sides of that tree at the same time
 Well, if you saw tracks like that you'd guess it was some sort of stunt, of course
 But in the quantum world, this happens all the time
 Particles can multitask, they can be in two places at once
 They can do more than one thing at the same time
 Particles can behave like spread-out waves
 It's almost like magic
Physicists and chemists have had nearly a century of trying to get used to this weirdness
You see, this weirdness is very delicate; and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs
 We cool our system down to near absolute zero, we carry out our experiments in vacuums, we try and isolate it from any external disturbance
 Biology itself, if you think of molecular biology, seems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life in terms of chemistry -- chemical reactions
 And these are reductionist, deterministic chemical reactions, showing that, essentially, life is made of the same stuff as everything else, and if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world, then we should be able to forget about it in biology, as well
Well, one man begged to differ with this idea
 Erwin Schrödinger, of Schrödinger's Cat fame, was an Austrian physicist
 It influenced Francis Crick and James Watson, the discoverers of the double-helix structure of DNA
 To paraphrase a description in the book, he says: At the molecular level, living organisms have a certain order, a structure to them that's very different from the random thermodynamic jostling of atoms and molecules in inanimate matter of the same complexity
In fact, living matter seems to behave in this order, in a structure, just like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero, where quantum effects play a very important role
 There's something special about the structure -- the order -- inside a living cell
 It's a very speculative, far-reaching idea, and it didn't really go very far
But as I mentioned at the start, in the last 10 years, there have been experiments emerging, showing where some of these certain phenomena in biology do seem to require quantum mechanics
I want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones
 The box on the left shows the wavelike, spread-out distribution of a quantum entity -- a particle, like an electron, which is not a little ball bouncing off a wall
 It's a wave that has a certain probability of being able to permeate through a solid wall, like a phantom leaping through to the other side
 Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier, and yet somehow, as though by magic, disappear from one side and reappear on the other
 In the quantum world, you don't have to throw it over the wall, you can throw it at the wall, and there's a certain non-zero probability that it'll disappear on your side, and reappear on the other
This isn't speculation, by the way
 We're happy -- well, "happy" is not the right word --
we are familiar with this
Quantum tunneling takes place all the time; in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines
 The particles fuse together, and the Sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling
 Back in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place inside living cells
 Enzymes, those workhorses of life, the catalysts of chemical reactions -- enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in living cells, by many, many orders of magnitude
 And it's always been a mystery how they do this
Well, it was discovered that one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of, is by transferring subatomic particles, like electrons and indeed protons, from one part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling
 It's efficient, it's fast, it can disappear -- a proton can disappear from one place, and reappear on the other
This is research that's been carried out back in the 80s, particularly by a group in Berkeley, Judith Klinman
 Other groups in the UK have now also confirmed that enzymes really do this
 One question we asked is whether quantum tunneling plays a role in mutations in DNA
 Again, this is not a new idea; it goes all the way back to the early 60s
 The two strands of DNA, the double-helix structure, are held together by rungs; it's like a twisted ladder
 And those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds -- protons, that act as the glue between the two strands
 So if you zoom in, what they're doing is holding these large molecules -- nucleotides -- together
 Zoom in a bit more
 So, this a computer simulation
 The two white balls in the middle are protons, and you can see that it's a double hydrogen bond
 One prefers to sit on one side; the other, on the other side of the two strands of the vertical lines going down, which you can't see
 It can happen that these two protons can hop over
 Watch the two white balls
 They can jump over to the other side
This has been known for half a century
 The question is: How likely are they to do that, and if they do, how do they do it? Do they jump across, like the ball going over the wall? Or can they quantum-tunnel across, even if they don't have enough energy? Early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here
 It's speculative, but it's one of those questions that is so important that if quantum mechanics plays a role in mutations, surely this must have big implications, to understand certain types of mutations, possibly even those that lead to turning a cell cancerous
 It's the quantum skier
Some years ago, the world of science was shocked when a paper was published showing experimental evidence that quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria, carrying out photosynthesis
 The idea is that the photon, the particle of light, the sunlight, the quantum of light captured by a chlorophyll molecule, is then delivered to what's called the reaction center, where it can be turned into chemical energy
 And in getting there, it doesn't just follow one route; it follows multiple pathways at once, to optimize the most efficient way of reaching the reaction center without dissipating as waste heat
 Quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell
 A remarkable idea, and yet evidence is growing almost weekly, with new papers coming out, confirming that this does indeed take place
My third and final example is the most beautiful, wonderful idea
 It's also still very speculative, but I have to share it with you
 The European robin migrates from Scandinavia down to the Mediterranean, every autumn, and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects, they navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field
 Now, the Earth's magnetic field is very, very weak; it's 100 times weaker than a fridge magnet, and yet it affects the chemistry -- somehow -- within a living organism
 That's not in doubt -- a German couple of ornithologists, Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko, in the 1970s, confirmed that indeed, the robin does find its way by somehow sensing the Earth's magnetic field, to give it directional information -- a built-in compass
The puzzle, the mystery was: How does it do it? Well, the only theory in town -- we don't know if it's the correct theory, but the only theory in town -- is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement
 Inside the robin's retina -- I kid you not -- inside the robin's retina is a protein called cryptochrome, which is light-sensitive
 Within cryptochrome, a pair of electrons are quantum-entangled
 Now, quantum entanglement is when two particles are far apart, and yet somehow remain in contact with each other
 Even Einstein hated this idea; he called it "spooky action at a distance
"
So if Einstein doesn't like it, then we can all be uncomfortable with it
We don't know if it's the correct explanation, but wow, wouldn't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate? Quantum biology is still in it infancy
 It's still speculative
 I also think that in the coming decade or so, we're going to start to see that actually, it pervades life -- that life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world
 Watch this space
I was raised by lesbians in the mountains, and I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back
  Really messed with my head, but I'll get into that later
I'll start with when I was eight years old
 I took a wood box, and I buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado
 And I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas, maybe how we ate our spaghetti
 I really didn't know
 Anyway, this is kind of funny, because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes
Now, at some point I was in Hawaii -- I like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff, and I was making a collage for my ma
 And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up, and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid, and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck
 Now, she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them, so I poured more resin on the canvas, thinking I could hide it or something
 Instead, the opposite happened: It sort of created a magnification, like a magnifying glass, on the dictionary text
So what did I do? I built more boxes
 This time, I started putting electronics, frogs, strange bottles I'd find in the street -- anything I could find -- because I was always finding things my whole life, and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects
 First, botanical -- which you can kind of get a sense of
 Then I made some weird insects and creatures
 It was really fun; I was just drawing on the layers of resin
And it was cool, because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff, I was making some money, I could take my girlfriend for dinner, and like, go to Sizzler
 
At some point, I got up to the human form, life-size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers
 I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me
 And I went to bed every night thinking about it
So I tried using glass
 And this really worked, because I could stop using the resin
So I did this for years, which culminated in a very large work, which I call "The Triptych
" "The Triptych" was largely inspired by Hieronymus Bosch's "[The] Garden of Earthly Delights," which is a painting in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain
 Do you guys know this painting? Good, it's a cool painting
 It's kind of ahead of its time, they say
 So, "The Triptych
" I'll walk you through this piece
 It weighs 24,000 pounds
 It's 18 feet long
 It's double-sided, so it's 36 feet of composition
 It's kind of weird
 Well, that's the blood fountain
  To the left, you have Jesus and the locusts
 There's a cave where all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds
 They go from the representational world, to this analog-mesh underworld, where they're hiding
 This is where the animal-headed creatures are by the lighthouse, and they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean
 This is a bird god tied up to a battleship
 Anyway, this is a lady creature
 She's coming out of the ocean, and she's spitting oil into one hand and she has clouds coming out of her other hand
 Her hands are like scales, and she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance
So that's one side of "The Triptych
" It's a little narrative thing
 That's her hand that she's spitting into
 And then, when you go to the other side, she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak, and she's spitting clouds out of her trunk
 Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's tail that connects "The Triptych
" Anyway, her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano
  I don't know why that happened
That happens, you know
 Her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball, made out of 1986 terrorist cards
 Have you guys seen those? They were made in the 1980's, they're like baseball cards of terrorists
That will bring you to my latest project
 I'm in the middle of two projects: One's called "Psychogeographies
" It's about a six-year project to make 100 of these humans
 But each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human, and they travel in groups of 20, 4, or 12 at a time
 They're like cells -- they come together, they divide
 And you kind of walk through them
 It's taking me years
This one has a little cave in his chest
 I'm going to go down the body for you: There's a waterfall coming out of his chest, covering his penis -- or not-penis, or whatever it is, a kind of androgynous thing
 I'll take you quickly through these works, because I can't explain them for too long
 There are the layers, you can kind of see it
 That's a body getting split in half
 This one has two heads, and it's communicating between the two heads
 You can see the pills coming out, going into one head from this weird statue
 There's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity
 Can you see that?
Anyway, this talk's all about these boxes, like the boxes we're in
 This box we're in, the solar system is a box
 This brings you to my latest box
 It's a brick box
Inside of this box is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, a radio station, a museum, a school, a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world; a garden
 We shake this box up, and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles
 You redefine your insides and the box that you're living in
 And you come together to realize that we're all in this together, that this delusion of difference -- this idea of countries, of borders, of religion -- doesn't work
 We're all really made up of the same stuff, in the same box
 And if we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely, we're all going to die real soon
Thank you very much
For more than 100 years, the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments
For much of this time, this assistance was manual
 Surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand
 But as in so many other industries, computing has changed everything
 The telephone companies built surveillance features into the very core of their networks
 First and foremost
So what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse, your children, a colleague or your doctor on the telephone, someone could be listening
 Now, that someone might be your own government; it could also be another government, a foreign intelligence service, or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system, that hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies
But while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority, Silicon Valley companies have not
 And increasingly, over the last couple years, Silicon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely difficult
For example, many of you might have an iPhone, and if you use an iPhone to send a text message to other people who have an iPhone, those text messages cannot easily be wiretapped
 And in fact, according to Apple, they're not able to even see the text messages themselves
 Likewise, if you use FaceTime to make an audio call or a video call with one of your friends or loved ones, that, too, cannot be easily wiretapped
And it's not just Apple
So, after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call -- anytime, anywhere -- you might imagine that government officials are not very happy
 And in fact, that's what's happening
 Government officials are extremely mad
 What upsets them the most is that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products and turned them on by default
 It's the default piece that matters
In short, the tech companies have democratized encryption
 And so, government officials like British Prime Minister David Cameron, they believe that all communications -- emails, texts, voice calls -- all of these should be available to governments, and encryption is making that difficult
Now, look -- I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view
 We live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world, and there really are bad people out there
 There are terrorists and other serious national security threats that I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to monitor
But those surveillance features come at a cost
 The reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop, or a drug dealer's cell phone
 We all use the same communications devices
 What that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls or the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted, then so can the rest of ours, too
So the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described -- this is not imaginary
 In 2009, the surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks -- the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police -- those systems were compromised by the Chinese government, because the Chinese government wanted to figure out which of their own agents the US government was monitoring
By the same token, in 2004, the surveillance system built into the network of Vodafone Greece -- Greece's largest telephone company -- was compromised by an unknown entity, and that feature, the surveillance feature, was used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister and members of the Greek cabinet
 The foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught
And really, this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features, or backdoors
 When you build a backdoor into a communications network or piece of technology, you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it
And so for that reason, I think that it's better to build networks to be as secure as possible
 Yes, this means that in the future, encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult
 But the alternative would mean to live in a world where anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled by criminals, by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies
 And I don't want to live in that kind of world
And so right now, you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets, you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are, or how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are
And so, my message to you is this: We need to use these tools
 We need to secure our telephone calls
 We need to secure our text messages
 I want you to use these tools
 I want you to tell your loved ones, I want you to tell your colleagues: Use these encrypted communications tools
Thank you
This is a painting from the 16th century from Lucas Cranach the Elder
 It shows the famous Fountain of Youth
 If you drink its water or you bathe in it, you will get health and youth
 There are people like Alexander the Great or Ponce De León, the explorer, who spent much of their life chasing the Fountain of Youth
 They didn't find it
 But what if there was something to it? What if there was something to this Fountain of Youth?
I will share an absolutely amazing development in aging research that could revolutionize the way we think about aging and how we may treat age-related diseases in the future
 It started with experiments that showed, in a recent number of studies about growing, that animals -- old mice -- that share a blood supply with young mice can get rejuvenated
 This is similar to what you might see in humans, in Siamese twins, and I know this sounds a bit creepy
 But what Tom Rando, a stem-cell researcher, reported in 2007, was that old muscle from a mouse can be rejuvenated if it's exposed to young blood through common circulation
 This was reproduced by Amy Wagers at Harvard a few years later, and others then showed that similar rejuvenating effects could be observed in the pancreas, the liver and the heart
 But what I'm most excited about, and several other labs as well, is that this may even apply to the brain
So, what we found is that an old mouse exposed to a young environment in this model called parabiosis, shows a younger brain -- and a brain that functions better
 And I repeat: an old mouse that gets young blood through shared circulation looks younger and functions younger in its brain
 So when we get older -- we can look at different aspects of human cognition, and you can see on this slide here, we can look at reasoning, verbal ability and so forth
 And up to around age 50 or 60, these functions are all intact, and as I look at the young audience here in the room, we're all still fine
But it's scary to see how all these curves go south
One big problem we have -- to try to understand how this really works at a very molecular mechanistic level -- is that we can't study the brains in detail, in living people
 We can do cognitive tests, we can do imaging -- all kinds of sophisticated testing
 This is what neuropathologists do, for example
 So, how about we think of the brain as being part of the larger organism
 Could we potentially understand more about what happens in the brain at the molecular level if we see the brain as part of the entire body? So if the body ages or gets sick, does that affect the brain? And vice versa: as the brain gets older, does that influence the rest of the body? And what connects all the different tissues in the body is blood
 Blood is the tissue that not only carries cells that transport oxygen, for example, the red blood cells, or fights infectious diseases, but it also carries messenger molecules, hormone-like factors that transport information from one cell to another, from one tissue to another, including the brain
 And by and large, factors that we know are required for the development of tissues, for the maintenance of tissues -- they start to decrease as we get older, while factors involved in repair, in injury and in inflammation -- they increase as we get older
So there's this unbalance of good and bad factors, if you will
 And what we noticed first is that between the youngest and the oldest group, about half the factors changed significantly
 So our body lives in a very different environment as we get older, when it comes to these factors
 And using statistical or bioinformatics programs, we could try to discover those factors that best predict age -- in a way, back-calculate the relative age of a person
 And the way this looks is shown in this graph
 So, on the one axis you see the actual age a person lived, the chronological age
 So, how many years they lived
 But what's really exciting are the outliers, as they so often are in life
 So is this a person that actually looks much younger than their age? But more importantly: Is this a person who is maybe at a reduced risk to develop an age-related disease and will have a long life -- will live to 100 or more? On the other hand, the person here, highlighted with the red dot, is not even 40, but has a biological age of 65
So what I've shown you so far is simply correlational, right? You can just say, "Well, these factors change with age," but you don't really know if they do something about aging
 So what I'm going to show you now is very remarkable and it suggests that these factors can actually modulate the age of a tissue
 And that's where we come back to this model called parabiosis
So, parabiosis is done in mice by surgically connecting the two mice together, and that leads then to a shared blood system, where we can now ask, "How does the old brain get influenced by exposure to the young blood?" And for this purpose, we use young mice that are an equivalency of 20-year-old people, and old mice that are roughly 65 years old in human years
What we found is quite remarkable
 We find there are more neural stem cells that make new neurons in these old brains
 There's an increased activity of the synapses, the connections between neurons
 There are more genes expressed that are known to be involved in the formation of new memories
 And there's less of this bad inflammation
 So when we connect them, there are actually no cells going into the old brain, in this model
 Instead, we've reasoned, then, that it must be the soluble factors, so we could collect simply the soluble fraction of blood which is called plasma, and inject either young plasma or old plasma into these mice, and we could reproduce these rejuvenating effects, but what we could also do now is we could do memory tests with mice
As mice get older, like us humans, they have memory problems
 It's just harder to detect them, but I'll show you in a minute how we do that
 But we wanted to take this one step further, one step closer to potentially being relevant to humans
 What I'm showing you now are unpublished studies, where we used human plasma, young human plasma, and as a control, saline, and injected it into old mice, and asked, can we again rejuvenate these old mice? Can we make them smarter?
And to do this, we used a test
 It's called a Barnes maze
 This is a big table that has lots of holes in it, and there are guide marks around it, and there's a bright light, as on this stage here
 The mice hate this and they try to escape, and find the single hole that you see pointed at with an arrow, where a tube is mounted underneath where they can escape and feel comfortable in a dark hole
 So we teach them, over several days, to find this space on these cues in the space, and you can compare this for humans, to finding your car in a parking lot after a busy day of shopping
So, let's look at an old mouse here
 This is an old mouse that has memory problems, as you'll notice in a moment
 It just looks into every hole, but it didn't form this spacial map that would remind it where it was in the previous trial or the last day
 In stark contrast, this mouse here is a sibling of the same age, but it was treated with young human plasma for three weeks, with small injections every three days
 And as you noticed, it almost looks around, "Where am I?" -- and then walks straight to that hole and escapes
 And it also suggests that there is something not only in young mouse plasma, but in young human plasma that has the capacity to help this old brain
 So to summarize, we find the old mouse, and its brain in particular, are malleable
 They're not set in stone; we can actually change them
 It can be rejuvenated
 Young blood factors can reverse aging, and what I didn't show you -- in this model, the young mouse actually suffers from exposure to the old
 So there are old-blood factors that can accelerate aging
 Old human blood, I didn't show you, does not have this effect; it does not make the mice younger
So, is this magic transferable to humans? We're running a small clinical study at Stanford, where we treat Alzheimer's patients with mild disease with a pint of plasma from young volunteers, 20-year-olds, and do this once a week for four weeks, and then we look at their brains with imaging
 What we hope is that there are some signs of improvement from this treatment
Now, I don't think we will live forever
 And if we can turn it back on a little bit, maybe we can find the factors that are mediating these effects, we can produce these factors synthetically and we can treat diseases of aging, such as Alzheimer's disease or other dementias
Thank you very much
Over the past 10 years, I've been researching the way people organize and visualize information
For a long period of time, we believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us, also known as the great chain of being, or "Scala naturae" in Latin, a top-down structure that normally starts with God at the very top, followed by angels, noblemen, common people, animals, and so on
 But over time, interestingly enough, this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree in what became known as the Porphyrian tree, also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge
 We can see trees being used to map consanguinity, the various blood ties between people
 We can also see trees being used to map genealogy, perhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram
 I think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees
 Many of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way
 We can see trees even mapping systems of law, the various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers
 And finally, of course, also a very popular scientific metaphor, we can see trees being used to map all species known to man
 And trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor because in many ways, they really embody this human desire for order, for balance, for unity, for symmetry
However, nowadays we are really facing new complex, intricate challenges that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree diagram
 And a new metaphor is currently emerging, and it's currently replacing the tree in visualizing various systems of knowledge
 And this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network
 And we can see this shift from trees into networks in many domains of knowledge
We can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain
 While before, we used to think of the brain as a modular, centralized organ, where a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors, the more we know about the brain, the more we think of it as a large music symphony, played by hundreds and thousands of instruments
 This is a beautiful snapshot created by the Blue Brain Project, where you can see 10,000 neurons and 30 million connections
 We can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge
These are some remarkable trees of knowledge, or trees of science, by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull
" But perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge, at least for me, was created for the French encyclopedia by Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751
 This was really the bastion of the French Enlightenment, and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents for the encyclopedia
 And it actually maps out all domains of knowledge as separate branches of a tree
But knowledge is much more intricate than this
 These are two maps of Wikipedia showing the inter-linkage of articles -- related to history on the left, and mathematics on the right
 And I think by looking at these maps and other ones that have been created of Wikipedia -- arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man -- we can really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate and interdependent, just like a network
We can also see this interesting shift in the way we map social ties between people
 This is the typical organization chart
 I'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well, in your own corporations, or others
 It's a top-down structure that normally starts with the CEO at the very top, and where you can drill down all the way to the individual workmen on the bottom
 But humans sometimes are, well, actually, all humans are unique in their own way, and sometimes you really don't play well under this really rigid structure
I think the Internet is really changing this paradigm quite a lot
 This is a fantastic map of online social collaboration between Perl developers
 Perl is a famous programming language, and here, you can see how different programmers are actually exchanging files, and working together on a given project
 And here, you can notice that this is a completely decentralized process -- there's no leader in this organization, it's a network
We can also see this interesting shift when we look at terrorism
 The diagram that you see behind me shows all the terrorists involved in the Madrid attack in 2004
 And what they did here is, they actually segmented the network into three different years, represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me
 And the blue lines tie together the people that were present in that network year after year
 So even though there's no leader per se, these people are probably the most influential ones in that organization, the ones that know more about the past, and the future plans and goals of this particular cell
" There's actually a letter from Darwin to the publisher, expanding on the importance of this particular diagram
 It was critical for Darwin's theory of evolution
 But recently, scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life is a dense network of bacteria, and these bacteria are actually tying together species that were completely separated before, to what scientists are now calling not the tree of life, but the web of life, the network of life
And finally, we can really see this shift, again, when we look at ecosystems around our planet
 No more do we have these simplified predator-versus-prey diagrams we have all learned at school
 This is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem
 This is a diagram created by Professor David Lavigne, mapping close to 100 species that interact with the codfish off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada
 And I think here, we can really understand the intricate and interdependent nature of most ecosystems that abound on our planet
 It's almost becoming the syntax of a new language
 And this is one aspect that truly fascinates me
 And here is an example
 On the very top band, you have radial convergence, a visualization model that has become really popular over the last five years
 At the top left, the very first project is a gene network, followed by a network of IP addresses -- machines, servers -- followed by a network of Facebook friends
 You probably couldn't find more disparate topics, yet they are using the same metaphor, the same visual model, to map the never-ending complexities of its own subject
 And here are a few more examples of the many I've been collecting, of this growing visual taxonomy of networks
But networks are not just a scientific metaphor
 As designers, researchers, and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems, they are in many ways influencing traditional art fields, like painting and sculpture, and influencing many different artists
 And perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them -- they're immensely gorgeous -- they are really becoming a cultural meme, and driving a new art movement, which I've called "networkism
" And we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways
 This is just one of many examples, where you can see this influence from science into art
 The example on your left side is IP-mapping, a computer-generated map of IP addresses; again -- servers, machines
 And here are a few more paintings by Sharon Molloy, some gorgeous, intricate paintings
And here's another example of that interesting cross-pollination between science and art
 On your left side, you have "Operation Smile
 And on your right side, you have "Field 4," by Emma McNally, using only graphite on paper
 Emma McNally is one of the main leaders of this movement, and she creates these striking, imaginary landscapes, where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization
But networkism doesn't happen only in two dimensions
 This is perhaps one of my favorite projects of this new movement
" And I just find this particular project to be immensely powerful
 It was created by Tomás Saraceno, and he occupies these large spaces, creates these massive installations using only elastic ropes
 As you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes, the entire network kind of shifts, almost like a real organic network would
And here's yet another example of networkism taken to a whole different level
 This was created by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota in a piece called "In Silence
" And Chiharu, like Tomás Saraceno, fills these rooms with this dense network, this dense web of elastic ropes and black wool and thread, sometimes including objects, as you can see here, sometimes even including people, in many of her installations
 Networks really embody notions of decentralization, of interconnectedness, of interdependence
 And this new way of thinking is critical for us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays, from decoding the human brain, to understanding the vast universe out there
 On your left side, you have a snapshot of a neural network of a mouse -- very similar to our own at this particular scale
 And on your right side, you have the Millennium Simulation
 It was the largest and most realistic simulation of the growth of cosmic structure
 It was able to recreate the history of 20 million galaxies in approximately 25 terabytes of output
 And coincidentally or not, I just find this particular comparison between the smallest scale of knowledge -- the brain -- and the largest scale of knowledge -- the universe itself -- to be really quite striking and fascinating
 Because as Bruce Mau once said, "When everything is connected to everything else, for better or for worse, everything matters
"
Thank you so much
Today, I want to talk to you about dreams
I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life, and it's cooler than in the movies
  Beyond flying, breathing fire, and making hot men spontaneously appear 
 Fun fact is that I wrote my personal statement to college in a dream
 And I did accepted
 So, yeah
I am a very visual thinker
 I think in pictures, not words
 To me, words are more like instincts and language
There are many people like me; Nikola Tesla, for example, who could visualize, design, test, and troubleshoot everything -- all of his inventions -- in his mind, accurately
 I am a bit more primitive, like a beta version of Google Translate
 
My brain has the ability to hyper-focus on things that interest me
 For example, once I had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages
 
 You may have noticed that I don't have much inflection in my voice
 That's why people often confuse me with a GPS
  This can make basic communication a challenge, unless you need directions
  Thank you
 
A few years ago, when I started doing presentations, I went to get head shots done for the first time
 The photographer told me to look flirty
  And I had no idea what she was talking about
 
She said, "Do that thing, you know, with your eyes, when you're flirting with guys
"
"You know, squint
"
And so I tried, really
 It looked something like this
 
 
I have Asperger's, a high-functioning form of autism that impairs the basic social skills one is expected to display
 It's made life difficult in many ways, and growing up, I struggled to fit in socially
 My friends would tell jokes, but I didn't understand them
 My personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert -- and they taught me humor
 My personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm
 Needless to say, I did not have many friends
 I was also hypersensitive to texture
 The feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles, and so for years, I refused to shower
 
 And I had to travel 2,000 miles across the country to get treatment, but within days of them prescribing a new medication, my life turned into an episode of the Walking Dead
 I became paranoid, and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses were coming towards me
 My family finally rescued me, but by that time, I had lost 19 pounds in those three weeks, as well as developing severe anemia, and was on the verge of suicide
I transferred to a new treatment center that understood my aversions, my trauma, and my social anxiety, and they knew how to treat it, and I got the help I finally needed
 And after 18 months of hard work, I went on to do incredible things
 But there's a gap between where that stands, and how I communicate it with the rest of the world
Not many places would hire me, due to my lack of social skills, which is why I applied to Waffle House
  Waffle House is an exceptional 24-hour diner --   thank you -- where you can order your hash browns the many ways that someone would dispose of a human corpse 
  Sliced, diced, peppered, chunked, topped, capped, and covered
  As social norms would have it, you should only go to Waffle House at an ungodly hour in the night
  So one time, at 2 am, I was chatting with a waitress, and I asked her, "What's the most ridiculous thing that's happened to you on the job?" And she told me that one time, a man walked in completely naked
  I said, "Great! Sign me up for the graveyard shift!"  Needless to say, Waffle House did not hire me
So in terms of having Asperger's, it can be viewed as a disadvantage, and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt, but it's also the opposite
 It's a gift, and it allows me to think innovatively
 At 19, I won a research competition for my research on coral reefs, and I ended up speaking at the UN Convention of Biological Diversity, presenting this research
  And at 22, I'm getting ready to graduate college, and I am a co-founder of a biotech company called AutismSees
 
But consider what I had to do to get here: 25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses, and years of pain and trauma
 I spent a lot of time thinking if there's a better way, and I think there is: autism-assistive technology
 This technology could play an integral role in helping people with autistic spectrum disorder, or ASD
The app Podium, released by my company, AutismSees, has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills
 In addition to this, it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates a public-speaking and job-interview experience
 And so maybe one day, Waffle House will hire me, after practicing on it some more
  And one of the great things is that I've used Podium to help me prepare for today, and it's been a great help
 There's more that can be done
 But the problem that's encountered is that these brilliant ideas often can't be shared if there are communication roadblocks
 And so, many people with autism are being overlooked every day, and they're being taken advantage of
 So my dream for people with autism is to change that, to remove the roadblocks that prevent them from succeeding
 When I'm flying over scenes that I create in my mind, I am at peace
 I am free from judgment, and so I can do whatever I want, you know? I'm making out with Brad Pitt, and Angelina is totally cool with it
 
But the goal of autism-assistive technology is bigger than that, and more important
 My goal is to shift people's perspective of autism and people with higher-functioning Asperger's because there is a lot they can do
 I mean, look at Temple Grandin, for example
 And by doing so, we allow people to share their talents with this world and move this world forward
Thank you
What do you do when you have a headache? You swallow an aspirin
 But for this pill to get to your head, where the pain is, it goes through your stomach, intestines and various other organs first
Swallowing pills is the most effective and painless way of delivering any medication in the body
 The downside, though, is that swallowing any medication leads to its dilution
 When they take their anti-HIV drugs, these drugs are good for lowering the virus in the blood, and increasing the CD4 cell counts
 But they are also notorious for their adverse side effects, but mostly bad, because they get diluted by the time they get to the blood, and worse, by the time they get to the sites where it matters most: within the HIV viral reservoirs
 These areas in the body -- such as the lymph nodes, the nervous system, as well as the lungs -- where the virus is sleeping, and will not readily get delivered in the blood of patients that are under consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy
 However, upon discontinuation of therapy, the virus can awake and infect new cells in the blood
 One day, I sat and thought, "Can we deliver anti-HIV directly within its reservoir sites, without the risk of drug dilution?" As a laser scientist, the answer was just before my eyes: Lasers, of course
 If they can be used for dentistry, for diabetic wound-healing and surgery, they can be used for anything imaginable, including transporting drugs into cells
As a matter of fact, we are currently using laser pulses to poke or drill extremely tiny holes, which open and close almost immediately in HIV-infected cells, in order to deliver drugs within them
 "How is that possible?" you may ask
 The laser pierces the cell, while the cell swallows the drug in a matter of microseconds
 Before you even know it, the induced hole becomes immediately repaired
Now, we are currently testing this technology in test tubes or in Petri dishes, but the goal is to get this technology in the human body, apply it in the human body
 "How is that possible?" you may ask
 Well, the answer is: through a three-headed device
 Using the first head, which is our laser, we will make an incision in the site of infection
 Using the second head, which is a camera, we meander to the site of infection
 Finally, using a third head, which is a drug-spreading sprinkler, we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection, while the laser is again used to poke those cells open
Well, this might not seem like much right now
 But one day, if successful, this technology can lead to complete eradication of HIV in the body
 Yes
 A cure for HIV
 This is every HIV researcher's dream -- in our case, a cure lead by lasers
There's this quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that I love
 He says, "Don't hate the media
 Be the media
 I like working with media and technology because A, I'm familiar with them and I like the power they hold
 And B, I hate them and I'm terrified of the power they hold
I remember watching, in 2003, an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then-US Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld
 They were talking about the recent invasion of Iraq, and Rumsfeld is asked the question, "Well, we're hear about our body counts, but we never hear about theirs, why?" And Rumsfeld's answer is, "Well, we don't do body counts on other people
" Right?
It's estimated that between 150,000 to one million Iraqis, civilians, have died as a result of the US-led invasion in 2003
 That number is in stark contrast with the 4,486 US service members who died during that same window of time
 I wanted to do more than just bring awareness to this terrifying number
 I wanted to create a monument for the individual civilians who died as a result of the invasion
Monuments to war, such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial, are often enormous in scale
 I wanted my monument to live in the world, and to circulate
 I remember when I was a boy in school, my teacher assigned us this classic civics assignment where you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government
 And we were told, if we wrote a really good letter, if we really thought about it, we would get back more than just a simple formed letter as a reply
This is my "Notepad
 "Notepad" is an act of protest and an act of commemoration disguised as an everyday tablet of paper
 The lines of the paper, when magnified, are revealed to be micro-printed text that contains the details, the names, the dates and locations of individual Iraqi civilians that died
So, for the last 5 years, I've been taking pads of this paper, tons of this stuff, and smuggling it into the stationery supplies of the United States and the Coalition governments
I don't have to tell you guys this is not the place to discuss how I did that
But also, I've been meeting one-on-one with members and former members of the so-called Coalition of the Willing, who assisted in the invasion
And so, whenever I can, I meet with one of them, and I share the project with them
 May I give this to you? This is a special legal tablet
 It's actually part of an ongoing art project
 This is a special legal pad?
 And all of the lines of the paper are actually --
 Are they going to disappear?
 No, they're micro-printed text that contains the names of individual Iraqi civilians who have died since the invasion of Iraq
 Yeah
 OK
 Thank you
 MK: Thank you
 There's an envelope
 And please open it
 The paper you're holding in your hand contains the details of Iraqi civilians that died as result of the invasion
 I'd like you to use this paper and write a member of government
 You can help to smuggle this civilian body count into government archives
 Because every letter that's sent in to the government, and this is all across the world, of course -- every letter that is sent in is archived, filed and recorded
 Together, we can put this in the mailboxes and under the noses of people in power
 Everything that's sent in eventually becomes part of the permanent archive of our government, our shared historical record
Thank you
 So, tell me Matt, how did this idea come into your head, of "Notepad"?
 I'd just finished a project that dealt with the US Coalition side of the war and it was a black armband that was called the "Improvised Empathetic Device" which accumulated, in real time, the names, ranks, cause of death and location of US service members who had died overseas, and each time the Department of Defense or CENTCOM released their data, it would stab me in the arm
 Thank you so much
Imagine a place where your neighbors greet your children by name; a place with splendid vistas; a place where you can drive just 20 minutes and put your sailboat on the water
 It's a seductive place, isn't it?
I don't live there
  But I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip for two years, to the fastest-growing and whitest counties in America
What is a Whitopia? I define Whitopia in three ways: First, a Whitopia has posted at least six percent population growth since 2000
 Secondly, the majority of that growth comes from white migrants
 And third, the Whitopia has an ineffable charm, a pleasant look and feel, a je Ne sais quoi
 George, Utah; second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; and third, Forsyth County, Georgia
First stop, St
 George -- a beautiful town of red rock landscapes
 In the 1850s, Brigham Young dispatched families to St
 George to grow cotton because of the hot, arid climate
 I approached my time in each Whitopia like an anthropologist
 I made detailed spreadsheets of all the power brokers in the communities, who I needed to meet, where I needed to be, and I threw myself with gusto in these communities
 I went to zoning board meetings, I went to Democratic clubs and Republican clubs
 In St
 George, I rented a home at the Entrada, one of the town's premier gated communities
 There were no Motel 6's or Howard Johnsons for me
 I lived in Whitopia as a resident, and not like a visitor
I rented myself this home by phone
Golf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia
 When I went on my journey, I had barely ever held a golf club
 By the time I left, I was golfing at least three times a week
 
 Some of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on the golf courses
 One venture capitalist, for example, invited me to golf in his private club that had no minority members
I also went fishing
  Because I had never fished, this fellow had to teach me how to cast my line and what bait to use
I also played poker every weekend
 It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in
 My poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew, but they weren't bluffing about their social beliefs
 Some of the most raw, salty conversations I ever had during my journey were at the poker table
But it wasn't all fun
 The St
 George's Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration held regular and active protests against immigration, and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia is what a hot debate this would become
 It was a real-time preview, and so it has become
 
The book "A Thousand Places To See Before You Die" lists Coeur d'Alene -- it's a gorgeous paradise for huntsmen, boatmen and fishermen
My growing golf skills came in handy in Coeur d'Alene
 I golfed with retired LAPD cops
A
 racial unrest, for North Idaho, and they've built an expatriated community
 Given the conservatism of these cops, there's no surprise that North Idaho has a strong gun culture
 In fact, it is said, North Idaho has more gun dealers than gas stations
 So what's a resident to do to fit in? I hit the gun club
 When I rented a gun, the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind, until I showed him my New York City driver's license
 That's when he got nervous
 I'm not as bad a shot as I thought I might have been
What I learned from North Idaho is the peculiar brand of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around
In North Idaho, in my red pickup truck, I kept a notepad
 And in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people
 In North Idaho, I found Confederate flags on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia, and on cars
About a seven-minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of Aryan Nations, the white supremacist group
 America's Promise Ministries, the religious arm of Aryan Nations, happened to have a three-day retreat during my visit
 So I decided to crash it
  I'm the only non-Aryan journalist I'm aware of ever to have done so
  Among the many memorable episodes of that retreat
  
is when Abe, an Aryan, sidled up next to me
 We are white separatists
" 
Indeed, most white people in Whitopia are neither white supremacists or white separatists; in fact, they're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all
Next stop was Georgia
 In Georgia, I stayed in an exurb north of Atlanta
 In Utah, I found poker; in Idaho, I found guns; in Georgia, I found God
 I was active in the youth ministry
 That is because [there], in Georgia, white people and black people are more historically familiar to one another
 It's possible for people to be in Whitopia not for racist reasons, though it has racist outcomes
 Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals, social welfare abuse, minorities, density, crowded schools
 Many Whitopians feel pulled by merit, freedom, the allure of privatism -- privatized places, privatized people, privatized things
 And I learned in Whitopia how a country can have racism without racists
Many of my smug urban liberal friends couldn't believe I would go on such a venture
 The reality is that many white Americans are affable and kind
 Interpersonal race relations -- how we treat each other as human beings -- are vastly better than in my parents' generation
 Can you imagine me going to Whitopia 40 years ago? What a journey that would have been
  And yet, some things haven't changed
 America is as residentially and educationally segregated today as it was in 1970
One of the Whitopian outlooks that really hit me was a proverbial saying: "One black man is a delightful dinner guest; 50 black men is a ghetto
"
One of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year 2042
 By 2042, white people will no longer be the American majority
 As such, will there be more Whitopias? In looking at this, the danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation we have, the less we can look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias
  I didn't expect to learn so much about myself
 I don't expect I'll be living in a Whitopia -- or a Blacktopia, for that matter
 I do plan to continue golfing every chance I get
  And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia
Thank you
For the past decade, I've been studying non-state armed groups: armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or militias
 I document what these groups do when they're not shooting
 My goal is to better understand these violent actors and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to nonviolent confrontation
 I work in the field, in the policy world and in the library
Understanding non-state armed groups is key to solving most ongoing conflict, because war has changed
 It used to be a contest between states
 No longer
 For example, of the 216 peace agreements signed between 1975 and 2011, 196 of them were between a state and a non-state actor
 So we need to understand these groups; we need to either engage them or defeat them in any conflict resolution process that has to be successful
So how do we do that? We need to know what makes these organizations tick
 We know a lot about how they fight, why they fight, but no one looks at what they're doing when they're not fighting
 Yet, armed struggle and unarmed politics are related
 We cannot understand these groups, let alone defeat them, if we don't have the full picture
And armed groups today are complex organizations
 Take the Lebanese Hezbollah, known for its violent confrontation against Israel
 Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas, known for its suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007
 So these groups do way more than just shoot
 They multi-task
 They set up complex communication machines -- radio stations, TV channels, Internet websites and social media strategies
 And up here, you have the ISIS magazine, printed in English and published to recruit
 Armed groups also invest in complex fund-raising -- not looting, but setting up profitable businesses; for example, construction companies
 Now, these activities are keys
 They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to better recruit and to build their brand
Armed groups also do something else: they build stronger bonds with the population by investing in social services
 They build schools, they run hospitals, they set up vocational-training programs or micro-loan programs
 Armed groups also seek to win the population over by offering something that the state is not providing: safety and security
 The initial rise of the Taliban in war-torn Afghanistan, or even the beginning of the ascent of ISIS, can be understood also by looking at these groups' efforts to provide security
 Now, unfortunately, in these cases, the provision of security came at an unbearably high price for the population
 But in general, providing social services fills a gap, a governance gap left by the government, and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power
 For example, the 2006 electoral victory of the Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the group's social work
Now, this is a really complex picture, yet in the West, when we look at armed groups, we only think of the violent side
 But that's not enough to understand these groups' strength, strategy or long-term vision
 These groups are hybrid
 They rise because they fill a gap left by the government, and they emerge to be both armed and political, engage in violent struggle and provide governance
And the more these organizations are complex and sophisticated, the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state
 Now, what do you call a group like Hezbollah? They run part of a territory, they administer all their functions, they pick up the garbage, they run the sewage system
 Is this a state? Is it a rebel group? Or maybe something else, something different and new? And what about ISIS? The lines are blurred
 We live in a world of states, non-states, and in-between, and the more states are weak, like in the Middle East today, the more non-state actors step in and fill that gap
 This matters for governments, because to counter these groups, they will have to invest more in non-military tools
 Filling that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach
 This also matters very much for peacemaking and peacebuilding
 If we better understand armed groups, we will better know what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolence
So in this new contest between states and non-states, military power can win some battles, but it will not give us peace nor stability
 To achieve these objectives, what we need is a long-term investment in filling that security gap, in filling that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in the first place
Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors were insignificant animals
 The most important thing to know about prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant
 Their impact on the world was not much greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers
 Today, in contrast, we control this planet
Usually, we look for the difference between us and all the other animals on the individual level
 We want to believe -- I want to believe -- that there is something special about me, about my body, about my brain, that makes me so superior to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee
 And if you take me and a chimpanzee and put us together on some lonely island, and we had to struggle for survival to see who survives better, I would definitely place my bet on the chimpanzee, not on myself
 And this is not something wrong with me personally
 I guess if they took almost any one of you, and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island, the chimpanzee would do much better
The real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level; it's on the collective level
 Humans control the planet because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers
 Now, there are other animals -- like the social insects, the bees, the ants -- that can cooperate in large numbers, but they don't do so flexibly
 Their cooperation is very rigid
 There is basically just one way in which a beehive can function
 And if there's a new opportunity or a new danger, the bees cannot reinvent the social system overnight
 They cannot, for example, execute the queen and establish a republic of bees, or a communist dictatorship of worker bees
Other animals, like the social mammals -- the wolves, the elephants, the dolphins, the chimpanzees -- they can cooperate much more flexibly, but they do so only in small numbers, because cooperation among chimpanzees is based on intimate knowledge, one of the other
 I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee, and I want to cooperate with you
 I need to know you personally
 What kind of chimpanzee are you? Are you a nice chimpanzee? Are you an evil chimpanzee? Are you trustworthy? If I don't know you, how can I cooperate with you?
The only animal that can combine the two abilities together and cooperate both flexibly and still do so in very large numbers is us, Homo sapiens
 One versus one, or even 10 versus 10, chimpanzees might be better than us
 But, if you pit 1,000 humans against 1,000 chimpanzees, the humans will win easily, for the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees cannot cooperate at all
 And if you now try to cram 100,000 chimpanzees into Oxford Street, or into Wembley Stadium, or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican, you will get chaos, complete chaos
 Just imagine Wembley Stadium with 100,000 chimpanzees
 Complete madness
In contrast, humans normally gather there in tens of thousands, and what we get is not chaos, usually
 What we get is extremely sophisticated and effective networks of cooperation
 All the huge achievements of humankind throughout history, whether it's building the pyramids or flying to the moon, have been based not on individual abilities, but on this ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers
Think even about this very talk that I'm giving now: I'm standing here in front of an audience of about 300 or 400 people, most of you are complete strangers to me
 Similarly, I don't really know all the people who have organized and worked on this event
 I don't know the pilot and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here, yesterday, to London
 I don't know the people who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras, which are recording what I'm saying
 I don't know the people who wrote all the books and articles that I read in preparation for this talk
 And I certainly don't know all the people who might be watching this talk over the Internet, somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi
Nevertheless, even though we don't know each other, we can work together to create this global exchange of ideas
 This is something chimpanzees cannot do
 Now cooperation is, of course, not always nice; all the horrible things humans have been doing throughout history -- and we have been doing some very horrible things -- all those things are also based on large-scale cooperation
 Prisons are a system of cooperation; slaughterhouses are a system of cooperation; concentration camps are a system of cooperation
 The next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener is: How, exactly, do we do it? What enables us alone, of all the animals, to cooperate in such a way? The answer is our imagination
 And as long as everybody believes in the same fiction, everybody obeys and follows the same rules, the same norms, the same values
All other animals use their communication system only to describe reality
 A chimpanzee may say, "Look! There's a lion, let's run away!" Or, "Look! There's a banana tree over there! Let's go and get bananas!" Humans, in contrast, use their language not merely to describe reality, but also to create new realities, fictional realities
 A human can say, "Look, there is a god above the clouds! And if you don't do what I tell you to do, when you die, God will punish you and send you to hell
 This is something only humans can do
 You can never convince a chimpanzee to give you a banana by promising him, "
 after you die, you'll go to chimpanzee heaven 
"  "
 and you'll receive lots and lots of bananas for your good deeds
 So now give me this banana
" No chimpanzee will ever believe such a story
 Only humans believe such stories, which is why we control the world, whereas the chimpanzees are locked up in zoos and research laboratories
 Millions of people come together to build a cathedral or a mosque or fight in a crusade or a jihad, because they all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell
 But what I want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism underlies all other forms of mass-scale human cooperation, not only in the religious field
Take, for example, the legal field
 Most legal systems today in the world are based on a belief in human rights
 But what are human rights? Human rights, just like God and heaven, are just a story that we've invented
 They are not an objective reality; they are not some biological effect about homo sapiens
 Take a human being, cut him open, look inside, you will find the heart, the kidneys, neurons, hormones, DNA, but you won't find any rights
 The only place you find rights are in the stories that we have invented and spread around over the last few centuries
 They may be very positive stories, very good stories, but they're still just fictional stories that we've invented
The same is true of the political field
 The most important factors in modern politics are states and nations
 But what are states and nations? They are not an objective reality
 A mountain is an objective reality
 You can see it, you can touch it, you can ever smell it
 But a nation or a state, like Israel or Iran or France or Germany, this is just a story that we've invented and became extremely attached to
The same is true of the economic field
 The most important actors today in the global economy are companies and corporations
 Many of you today, perhaps, work for a corporation, like Google or Toyota or McDonald's
 They are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers
  And what do corporations do all day? Mostly, they try to make money
 Yet, what is money? Again, money is not an objective reality; it has no objective value
 Look at it -- it has no value
 But then came along these master storytellers -- the big bankers, the finance ministers, the prime ministers -- and they tell us a very convincing story: "Look, you see this green piece of paper? It is actually worth 10 bananas
" And if I believe it, and you believe it, and everybody believes it, it actually works
 I can take this worthless piece of paper, go to the supermarket, give it to a complete stranger whom I've never met before, and get, in exchange, real bananas which I can actually eat
 This is something amazing
 You could never do it with chimpanzees
 Chimpanzees trade, of course: "Yes, you give me a coconut, I'll give you a banana
" That can work
 But, you give me a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana? No way! What do you think I am, a human? 
Money, in fact, is the most successful story ever invented and told by humans, because it is the only story everybody believes
 Not everybody believes in God, not everybody believes in human rights, not everybody believes in nationalism, but everybody believes in money, and in the dollar bill
 Take, even, Osama Bin Laden
 He hated American politics and American religion and American culture, but he had no objection to American dollars
 He was quite fond of them, actually
 
 We humans control the world because we live in a dual reality
 All other animals live in an objective reality
 Their reality consists of objective entities, like rivers and trees and lions and elephants
 And what is amazing is that as history unfolded, this fictional reality became more and more powerful so that today, the most powerful forces in the world are these fictional entities
 Today, the very survival of rivers and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes of fictional entities, like the United States, like Google, like the World Bank -- entities that exist only in our own imagination
 
 Yuval, you have a new book out
 After Sapiens, you wrote another one, and it's out in Hebrew, but not yet translated into 
 I'm working on the translation as we speak
 In the book, if I understand it correctly, you argue that the amazing breakthroughs that we are experiencing right now not only will potentially make our lives better, but they will create -- and I quote you -- "
 new classes and new class struggles, just as the industrial revolution did
" Can you elaborate for us?
 In the industrial revolution, we saw the creation of a new class of the urban proletariat
 And much of the political and social history of the last 200 years involved what to do with this class, and the new problems and opportunities
  As computers become better and better in more and more fields, there is a distinct possibility that computers will out-perform us in most tasks and will make humans redundant
 And then the big political and economic question of the 21st century will be, "What do we need humans for?", or at least, "What do we need so many humans for?"
 Do you have an answer in the book?
 At present, the best guess we have is to keep them happy with drugs and computer games 
  but this doesn't sound like a very appealing future
 Again, it's not a prophecy; it's seeing all kinds of possibilities before us
 One possibility is this creation of a new massive class of useless people
 Another possibility is the division of humankind into different biological castes, with the rich being upgraded into virtual gods, and the poor being degraded to this level of useless people
 I feel there is another TED talk coming up in a year or two
 Thank you, Yuval, for making the trip
 Thanks! 
In 2012, when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque in my hometown of Gabés, in the south of Tunisia, I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city
At the beginning, I was just looking for a wall in my hometown, and it happened that the minaret was built in '94
 And for 18 years, those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey
 When I met the imam for the first time, and I told him what I wanted to do, he was like, "Thank God you finally came," and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody to do something on it
 The most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything -- neither a sketch, or what I was going to write
In every work that I create, I write messages with my style of calligraffiti -- a mix of calligraphy and graffiti
 I use quotes or poetry
 For the minaret, I thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the Quran, so I picked this verse: "Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female, and made you people and tribe, so you may know each other
" It was a universal call for peace, tolerance, and acceptance coming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media
I was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting, and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention from international press all around the world
 He hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city, and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia
 The universality of the message, the political context of Tunisia at this time, and the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way were not insignificant
 It reunited the community
 What is funny, actually, is that even Arabic-speaking people really need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing
 You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece
 I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes
 There is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate
 Arabic script speaks to anyone, I believe; to you, to you, to you, to anybody, and then when you get the meaning, you feel connected to it
 I always make sure to write messages that are relevant to the place where I'm painting, but messages that have a universal dimension, so anybody around the world can connect to it
I was born and raised in France, in Paris, and I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was 18
 One of the reasons this is so important to me, is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world
In Rio de Janeiro, I translated this Portuguese poem from Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa, who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela, and then I painted it on the rooftop
 The local community were really intrigued by what I was doing, but as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy, they thanked me, as they felt connected to the piece
In South Africa, in Cape Town, the local community of Philippi offered me the only concrete wall of the slum
" Then this guy came to me and said, "Man, why you don't write in English?" and I replied to him, "I would consider your concern legit if you asked me why I didn't write in Zulu
"
 And when he saw I was painting in Arabic, he got so mad -- actually, hysterical -- and he asked for the wall to be erased
 I was mad and disappointed
 So, this guy --  like, was forced to see it every day
 At the beginning, I was going to write, "[In Arabic]," which means, "In your face," but --  I decided to be smarter and I wrote, "[In Arabic]," which means, "Open your heart
I'm really proud of my culture, and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork
 And I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know, with the beauty of Arabic script
 Today, I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall
 I don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken, as it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning, as you can enjoy any music from other countries
 Some people see that as a rejection or a closed door, but for me, it's more an invitation -- to my language, to my culture, and to my art
Thank you
This is a map of New York State that was made in 1937 by the General Drafting Company
 It's an extremely famous map among cartography nerds, because down here at the bottom of the Catskill Mountains, there is a little town called Roscoe -- actually, this will go easier if I just put it up here -- There's Roscoe, and then right above Roscoe is Rockland, New York, and then right above that is the tiny town of Agloe, New York
 It's also known as a copyright trap
 Mapmakers -- because my map of New York and your map of New York are going to look very similar, on account of the shape of New York -- often, mapmakers will insert fake places onto their maps, in order to protect their copyright
 Because then, if my fake place shows up on your map, I can be well and truly sure that you have robbed me
] Lindberg, and they released this map in 1937
 Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map with Agloe, New York, on it, at the same exact intersection of two dirt roads in the middle of nowhere
 Well, you can imagine the delight over at General Drafting
 We're going to sue your pants off!" And Rand McNally says, "No, no, no, no, Agloe is real
in the middle of nowhere, expecting there to be a place called Agloe -- someone built a place called Agloe, New York
And this is of course a completely irresistible metaphor to a novelist, because we would all like to believe that the stuff that we write down on paper can change the actual world in which we're actually living, which is why my third book is called "Paper Towns"
But what interests me ultimately more than the medium in which this happened, is the phenomenon itself
 It's easy enough to say that the world shapes our maps of the world, right? Like the overall shape of the world is obviously going to affect our maps
 But what I find a lot more interesting is the way that the manner in which we map the world changes the world
 Because the world would truly be a different place if North were down
 And the world would be a truly different place if Alaska and Russia weren't on opposite sides of the map
 The world is changed by our maps of the world
 The way that we choose -- sort of, our personal cartographic enterprise, also shapes the map of our lives, and that in turn shapes our lives
I believe that what we map changes the life we lead
 And I don't mean that in some, like, secret-y Oprah's Angels network, like, you-can-think-your-way- out-of-cancer sense
 You very rarely go to a place that isn't on your personal map
So I was a really terrible student when I was a kid
 My GPA was consistently in the low 2s
 And I think the reason that I was such a terrible student is that I felt like education was just a series of hurdles that had been erected before me, and I had to jump over in order to achieve adulthood
 And I didn't really want to jump over these hurdles, because they seemed completely arbitrary, so I often wouldn't, and then people would threaten me, you know, they'd threaten me with this "going on [my] permanent record," or "You'll never get a good job
" I didn't want a good job! As far as I could tell at eleven or twelve years old, like, people with good jobs woke up very early in the morning,
and the men who had good jobs, one of the first things they did was tie a strangulation item of clothing around their necks
 They literally put nooses on themselves, and then they went off to their jobs, whatever they were
 That's not a recipe for a happy life
 These people -- in my, symbol-obsessed, twelve year-old imagination -- these people who are strangling themselves as one of the first things they do each morning, they can't possibly be happy
 Why would I want to jump over all of these hurdles and have that be the end? That's a terrible end!
And then, when I was in tenth grade, I went to this school, Indian Springs School, a small boarding school, outside of Birmingham, Alabama
 And all at once I became a learner
 And I became a learner, because I found myself in a community of learners
 And so I started to learn, because learning was cool
 I learned that some infinite sets are bigger than other infinite sets, and I learned that iambic pentameter is and why it sounds so good to human ears
 I learned that the Civil War was a nationalizing conflict, I learned some physics, I learned that correlation shouldn't be confused with causation -- all of these things, by the way, enriched my life on a literally daily basis
 And it's true that I don't use most of them for my "job," but that's not what it's about for me
 It's about cartography
What is the process of cartography? It's, you know, sailing upon some land, and thinking, "I think I'll draw that bit of land," and then wondering, "Maybe there's some more land to draw
" And that's when learning really began for me
 It's true that I had teachers that didn't give up on me, and I was very fortunate to have those teachers, because I often gave them cause to think there was no reason to invest in me
 But a lot of the learning that I did in high school wasn't about what happened inside the classroom, it was about what happened outside of the classroom
 For instance, I can tell you that "There's a certain Slant of light, Winter Afternoons -- That oppresses, like the Heft Of Cathedral Tunes --" not because I memorized Emily Dickinson in school when I was in high school, but because there was a girl when I was in high school, and her name was Amanda, and I had a crush on her, and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry
 The reason I can tell you what opportunity cost is, is because one day when I was playing Super Mario Kart on my couch, my friend Emmet walked in, and he said, "How long have you been playing Super Mario Kart?" And I said, "I don't know, like, six hours?" and he said, "Do you realize that if you'd worked at Baskin-Robbins those six hours, you could have made 30 dollars, so in some ways, you just paid thirty dollars to play Super Mario Kart
" And I was, like, "I'll take that deal
"
But I learned what opportunity cost is
And along the way, the map of my life got better
 It got bigger; it contained more places
 There were more things that might happen, more futures I might have
 It wasn't a formal, organized learning process, and I'm happy to admit that
 It was spotty, it was inconsistent, there was a lot I didn't know
 I might know, you know, Cantor's idea that some infinite sets are larger than other infinite sets, but I didn't really understand the calculus behind that idea
 I might know the idea of opportunity cost, but I didn't know the law of diminishing returns
 But the great thing about imagining learning as cartography, instead of imagining it as arbitrary hurdles that you have to jump over, is that you see a bit of coastline, and that makes you want to see more
 And so now I do know at least some of the calculus that underlies all of that stuff
So, I had one learning community in high school, then I went to another for college, and then I went to another, when I started working at a magazine called "Booklist," where I was an assistant, surrounded by astonishingly well-read people
 And like all authors dream of doing, I promptly quit my job
And for the first time since high school, I found myself without a learning community, and it was miserable
 I hated it
 I read many, many books during this two-year period
 I read books about Stalin, and books about how the Uzbek people came to identify as Muslims, and I read books about how to make atomic bombs, but it just felt like I was creating my own hurdles, and then jumping over them myself, instead of feeling the excitement of being part of a community of learners, a community of people who are engaged together in the cartographic enterprise of trying to better understand and map the world around us
And then, in 2006, I met that guy
 His name is Ze Frank
 I didn't actually meet him, just on the Internet
 Ze Frank was running, at the time, a show called "The Show with Ze Frank," and I discovered the show, and that was my way back into being a community learner again
 Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas:
 Almost everything here was brought from somewhere else -- the sort of rocks, the trees, the waterfalls
 These fish are almost as out of place as my pig that flew
 Contrasted to the scorching desert that surrounds this place, so are these people
 Things from all over the world have been rebuilt here, away from their histories, and away from the people that experience them differently
 Here, there's no reason to feel like you're missing anything
 This New York means the same to me as it does to everyone else
 Everything is out of context, and that means context allows for everything: Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef
 This fabrication of place could be one of the world's greatest achievements, because no one belongs here; everyone does
 But unlike most mirrors, which present you with an outside view of yourself embedded in a place, these mirrors come back empty
 Makes me nostalgic for the days when you could see the pixels in online video
Ze isn't just a great public intellectual, he's also a brilliant community builder, and the community of people that built up around these videos was in many ways a community of learners
 So we played Ze Frank at chess collaboratively, and we beat him
 We organized ourselves to take a young man on a road trip across the United States
 I realize that these are silly ideas, but they are also "learny" ideas, and that was what was so exciting to me, and if you go online, you can find communities like this all over the place
 Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr, and yes, you will see people complaining about calculus, but you'll also see people re-blogging those complaints, making the argument that calculus is interesting and beautiful, and here's a way in to thinking about the problem that you find unsolvable
 You can go to places like Reddit, and find sub-Reddits, like "Ask a Historian" or "Ask Science," where you can ask people who are in these fields a wide range of questions, from very serious ones to very silly ones
 But to me, the most interesting communities of learners that are growing up on the Internet right now are on YouTube, and admittedly, I am biased
 But I think in a lot of ways, the YouTube page resembles a classroom
 Look for instance at "Minute Physics," a guy who's teaching the world about physics:
 Let's cut to the chase
 As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson is the last fundamental piece of the standard model of particle physics to be discovered experimentally
 But, you might ask, why was the Higgs boson included in the standard model, alongside well-known particles like electrons and photons and quarks, if it hadn't been discovered back then in the 1970s? Good question
 There are two main reasons
 First, just like the electron is an excitation in the electron field, the Higgs boson is simply a particle which is an excitation of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field
 The Higgs field in turn plays an integral role in our model for the weak nuclear force
 In particular, the Higgs field helps explain why it's so weak
 The immediate cause was of course the assassination in Sarajevo of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand, on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb nationalist named Gavrilo Princip
 So Franz Ferdinand wasn't particularly well-liked by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph -- now that is a mustache! But even so, the assassination led Austria to issue an ultimatum to Serbia, whereupon Serbia accepted some, but not all, of Austria's demands, leading Austria to declare war against Serbia
 And then Russia, due to its alliance with the Serbs, mobilized its army
 Germany, because it had an alliance with Austria, told Russia to stop mobilizing, which Russia failed to do, so then Germany mobilized its own army, declared war on Russia, cemented an alliance with the Ottomans, and then declared war on France, because, you know, France
And it's not just physics and world history that people are choosing to learn through YouTube
 Here's a video about abstract mathematics
 So you're me, and you're in math class yet again, because they make you go every single day
 And you're learning about, I don't know, the sums of infinite series
" But the whole concept of things like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on approaches one, is useful if, say, you want to draw a line of elephants, each holding the tail of the next one: normal elephant, young elephant, baby elephant, dog-sized elephant, puppy-sized elephant, all the way down to Mr
 Tusks and beyond
 Which is at least a tiny bit awesome, because you can get an infinite number of elephants in a line, and still have it fit across a single notebook page
 And lastly, here's Destin, from "Smarter Every Day," talking about the conservation of angular momentum, and, since it's YouTube, cats:
 Hey, it's me, Destin
 Welcome back to "Smarter Every Day
" So you've probably observed that cats almost always land on their feet
 For instance, let me reword this question: How does a cat go from feet-up to feet-down in a falling reference frame, without violating the conservation of angular momentum?
 So, here's something all four of these videos have in common: They all have more than half a million views on YouTube
 And those are people watching not in classrooms, but because they are part of the communities of learning that are being set up by these channels
 And I said earlier that YouTube is like a classroom to me, and in many ways it is, because here is the instructor -- it's like the old-fashioned classroom: here's the instructor, and then beneath the instructor are the students, and they're all having a conversation
 And I know that YouTube comments have a very bad reputation in the world of the Internet, but in fact, if you go on comments for these channels, what you'll find is people engaging the subject matter, asking difficult, complicated questions that are about the subject matter, and then other people answering those questions
 Invented calculus
["Liberal capitalism is not at all the Good of humanity
 Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle of savage, destructive nihilism
In case you can't see what she says 
I really believe that these spaces, these communities, have become for a new generation of learners, the kind of communities, the kind of cartographic communities that I had when I was in high school, and then again when I was in college
 And as an adult, re-finding these communities has re-introduced me to a community of learners, and has encouraged me to continue to be a learner even in my adulthood, so that I no longer feel like learning is something reserved for the young
 Vi Hart and "Minute Physics" introduced me to all kinds of things that I didn't know before
 And I know that we all hearken back to the days of the Parisian salon in the Enlightenment, or to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish, "Oh, I wish I could have been a part of that, I wish I could have laughed at Dorothy Parker's jokes
And I truly, truly believe that when we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s, when we made Agloe real, we were just getting started
Thank you
So on my way here, the passenger next to me and I had a very interesting conversation during my flight
"
And I was like, "Peacebuilder?" 
Every day, I work to amplify the voices of women and to highlight their experiences and their participation in peace processes and conflict resolution, and because of my work, I recognize that the only way to ensure the full participation of women globally is by reclaiming religion
Now, this matter is vitally important to me
 As a young Muslim woman, I am very proud of my faith
 It gives me the strength and conviction to do my work every day
 But I can't overlook the damage that has been done in the name of religion, not just my own, but all of the world's major faiths
 The misrepresentation and misuse and manipulation of religious scripture has influenced our social and cultural norms, our laws, our daily lives, to a point where we sometimes don't recognize it
My parents moved from Libya, North Africa, to Canada in the early 1980s, and I am the middle child of 11 children
 Yes, 11
 But growing up, I saw my parents, both religiously devout and spiritual people, pray and praise God for their blessings, namely me of course, but among others
  They were kind and funny and patient, limitlessly patient, the kind of patience that having 11 kids forces you to have
 And they were fair
 I was never subjected to religion through a cultural lens
 I was treated the same, the same was expected of me
 Being one of 11 children is Diplomacy 101
  To this day, I am asked where I went to school, like, "Did you go to Kennedy School of Government?" and I look at them and I'm like, "No, I went to the Murabit School of International Affairs
" It's extremely exclusive
 You would have to talk to my mom to get in
 Lucky for you, she's here
 It teaches you focus; you have to talk fast or say less, because you will always get cut off
 It teaches you the importance of messaging
 You have to ask questions in the right way to get the answers you know you want, and you have to say no in the right way to keep the peace
 When my mom's favorite lamp broke, I had to be there when she was trying to find out how and by who, because I had to defend myself, because if you're not, then the finger is pointed at you, and before you know it, you will be grounded
 Mind you, I had only ever been to Libya before on vacation, and as a seven-year-old girl, it was magic
 It was ice cream and trips to the beach and really excited relatives
Turns out it's not the same as a 15-year-old young lady
 I very quickly became introduced to the cultural aspect of religion
 And even with the foundation my parents had provided for me, I found myself questioning the role of women in my faith
So at the Murabit School of International Affairs, we go very heavy on the debate, and rule number one is do your research, so that's what I did, and it surprised me how easy it was to find women in my faith who were leaders, who were innovative, who were strong -- politically, economically, even militarily
 Khadija financed the Islamic movement in its infancy
 We wouldn't be here if it weren't for her
 So why weren't we learning about her? Why weren't we learning about these women? Why were women being relegated to positions which predated the teachings of our faith? And why, if we are equal in the eyes of God, are we not equal in the eyes of men?
To me, it all came back to the lessons I had learned as a child
 The decision maker, the person who gets to control the message, is sitting at the table, and unfortunately, in every single world faith, they are not women
 Religious institutions are dominated by men and driven by male leadership, and they create policies in their likeness, and until we can change the system entirely, then we can't realistically expect to have full economic and political participation of women
 Our foundation is broken
 My mom actually says, you can't build a straight house on a crooked foundation
In 2011, the Libyan revolution broke out, and my family was on the front lines
 And there's this amazing thing that happens in war, a cultural shift almost, very temporary
 And it was the first time that I felt it was not only acceptable for me to be involved, but it was encouraged
 It was demanded
 Myself and other women had a seat at the table
 We were information sharing
 We were crucial
 And I wanted and needed for that change to be permanent
Turns out, that's not that easy
 It only took a few weeks before the women that I had previously worked with were returning back to their previous roles, and most of them were driven by words of encouragement from religious and political leaders, most of whom cited religious scripture as their defense
So initially, I focused on the economic and political empowerment of women
 I thought that would lead to cultural and social change
 It turns out, it does a little, but not a lot
 I decided to use their defense as my offense, and I began to cite and highlight Islamic scripture as well
In 2012 and 2013, my organization led the single largest and most widespread campaign in Libya
 We entered homes and schools and universities, even mosques
 We spoke to 50,000 people directly, and hundreds of thousands more through billboards and television commercials, radio commercials and posters
 I used scripture
 I used verses from the Quran and sayings of the Prophet, Hadiths, his sayings which are, for example, "The best of you is the best to their family
" "Do not let your brother oppress another
" For the first time, Friday sermons led by local community imams promoted the rights of women
 They discussed taboo issues, like domestic violence
 Policies were changed
 So really, the United Nations just copied us
By changing the message, we were able to provide an alternative narrative which promoted the rights of women in Libya
 Liberals will say you're using religion and call you a bad conservative
 Conservatives will call you a lot of colorful things
 I've heard everything from, "Your parents must be extremely ashamed of you" -- false; they're my biggest fans -- to "You will not make it to your next birthday" -- again wrong, because I did
 And I remain a very strong believer that women's rights and religion are not mutually exclusive
 But we have to be at the table
 We have to stop giving up our position, because by remaining silent, we allow for the continued persecution and abuse of women worldwide
 You will have your fair share of insults and ridicule and threats
 But we have to do it
 We have no other option than to reclaim the message of human rights, the principles of our faith, not for us, not for the women in your families, not for the women in this room, not even for the women out there, but for societies that would be transformed with the participation of women
 And the only way we can do that, our only option, is to be, and remain, at the table
Thank you
" Voiceless people realized that they had a voice, and it was powerful and eloquent
 If a newspaper ran some racist or homophobic column, we realized we could do something about it
 We could get them
 We could hit them with a weapon that we understood but they didn't -- a social media shaming
 Advertisers would withdraw their advertising
 When powerful people misused their privilege, we were going to get them
 This was like the democratization of justice
 Hierarchies were being leveled out
 We were going to do things better
Soon after that, a disgraced pop science writer called Jonah Lehrer -- he'd been caught plagiarizing and faking quotes, and he was drenched in shame and regret, he told me
 And he had the opportunity to publicly apologize at a foundation lunch
 Maybe it would win him some salvation
 He knew before he arrived that the foundation was going to be live-streaming his event, but what he didn't know until he turned up, was that they'd erected a giant screen Twitter feed right next to his head
  Another one in a monitor screen in his eye line
I don't think the foundation did this because they were monstrous
 I think they were clueless: I think this was a unique moment when the beautiful naivety of Twitter was hitting the increasingly horrific reality
And here were some of the Tweets that were cascading into his eye line, as he was trying to apologize:
"Jonah Lehrer, boring us into forgiving him
" 
And, "Jonah Lehrer has not proven that he is capable of feeling shame
"
That one must have been written by the best psychiatrist ever, to know that about such a tiny figure behind a lectern
"
That last word is a very human thing to do, to dehumanize the people we hurt
 It's because we want to destroy people but not feel bad about it
You know, when we watch courtroom dramas, we tend to identify with the kindhearted defense attorney, but give us the power, and we become like hanging judges
Power shifts fast
 We were getting Jonah because he was perceived to have misused his privilege, but Jonah was on the floor then, and we were still kicking, and congratulating ourselves for punching up
 And it began to feel weird and empty when there wasn't a powerful person who had misused their privilege that we could get
Let me tell you a story
 It's about a woman called Justine Sacco
 It's 2014
 Get some deodorant
" -Inner monologue as inhale BO
 Thank god for pharmaceuticals
] So Justine chuckled to herself, and pressed send, and got no replies, and felt that sad feeling that we all feel when the Internet doesn't congratulate us for being funny
 And then she got to Heathrow, and she had a little time to spare before her final leg, so she thought up another funny little acerbic joke:
[Going to Africa
 Hope I don't get AIDS
 Just kidding
And she chuckled to herself, pressed send, got on the plane, got no replies, turned off her phone, fell asleep, woke up 11 hours later, turned on her phone while the plane was taxiing on the runway, and straightaway there was a message from somebody that she hadn't spoken to since high school, that said, "I am so sorry to see what's happening to you
 You are the worldwide number one trending topic on Twitter
" 
 A few weeks later, I talked to the Gawker journalist
 I emailed him and asked him how it felt, and he said, "It felt delicious
" And then he said, "But I'm sure she's fine
"
But she wasn't fine, because while she slept, Twitter took control of her life and dismantled it piece by piece
 bother you, join me in supporting @CARE's work in Africa
] [In light of 
 disgusting, racist tweet, I'm donating to @care today] Then came the beyond horrified: [
 no words for that horribly disgusting racist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco
 I am beyond horrified
]
Was anybody on Twitter that night? A few of you
 Did Justine's joke overwhelm your Twitter feed the way it did mine? It did mine, and I thought what everybody thought that night, which was, "Wow, somebody's screwed! Somebody's life is about to get terrible!" And I sat up in my bed, and I put the pillow behind my head, and then I thought, I'm not entirely sure that joke was intended to be racist
 There's a comedy tradition of this, like South Park or Colbert or Randy Newman
 Maybe Justine Sacco's crime was not being as good at it as Randy Newman
 In fact, when I met Justine a couple of weeks later in a bar, she was just crushed, and I asked her to explain the joke, and she said, "Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the Third World
You know, another woman on Twitter that night, a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis, she reviewed my book on public shaming and wrote that she Tweeted that night, "I'm not sure that her joke was intended to be racist," and she said straightaway she got a fury of Tweets saying, "Well, you're just a privileged bitch, too
" And so to her shame, she wrote, she shut up and watched as Justine's life got torn apart
It started to get darker: [Everyone go report this cunt @JustineSacco] Then came the calls for her to be fired
 [Good luck with the job hunt in the new year
 [@JustineSacco last tweet of your career
 #SorryNotSorry Corporations got involved, hoping to sell their products on the back of Justine's annihilation: [Next time you plan to tweet something stupid before you take off, make sure you are getting on a @Gogo flight!] 
 That month, between December the 20th and the end of December, her name was Googled 1,220,000 times
 And one Internet economist told me that that meant that Google made somewhere between 120,000 dollars and 468,000 dollars from Justine's annihilation, whereas those of us doing the actual shaming -- we got nothing
  We were like unpaid shaming interns for Google
 
And then came the trolls: [I'm actually kind of hoping Justine Sacco gets aids? lol] Somebody else on that wrote, "Somebody HIV-positive should rape this bitch and then we'll find out if her skin color protects her from AIDS
" And that person got a free pass
 We were all so excited about destroying Justine, and our shaming brains are so simple-minded, that we couldn't also handle destroying somebody who was inappropriately destroying Justine
 Justine was really uniting a lot of disparate groups that night, from philanthropists to "rape the bitch
 Just let the world know you're planning to ride bare back while in Africa
]
Women always have it worse than men
" When a woman gets shamed, it's, "I'm going to get you fired and raped and cut out your uterus
"
And then Justine's employers got involved: [IAC on @JustineSacco tweet: This is an outrageous, offensive comment
 Employee in question currently unreachable on an intl flight
] And that's when the anger turned to excitement: [All I want for Christmas is to see @JustineSacco's face when her plane lands and she checks her inbox/voicemail
 #fired] [Oh man, @justinesacco is going to have the most painful phone-turning-on moment ever when her plane lands
] [We are about to watch this @JustineSacco bitch get fired
 In REAL time
 Before she even KNOWS she's getting fired
] What we had was a delightful narrative arc
 We knew something that Justine didn't
 On Twitter that night, we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun
 Somebody worked out exactly which plane she was on, so they linked to a flight tracker website
 #hasJustineLandedYet] [Seriously
 I just want to go home to go to bed, but everyone at the bar is SO into #HasJustineLandedYet
 Can't look away
] [#HasJustineLandedYet may be the best thing to happen to my Friday night
] [Is no one in Cape Town going to the airport to tweet her arrival? Come on, twitter! I'd like pictures] And guess what? Yes there was
 [@JustineSacco HAS in fact landed at Cape Town international
 And if you want to know what it looks like to discover that you've just been torn to shreds because of a misconstrued liberal joke, not by trolls, but by nice people like us, this is what it looks like: [
 She's decided to wear sunnies as a disguise
]
 And if somebody gets in the way, we screen them out
 And do you know what that's the opposite of? It's the opposite of democracy
 We wanted to show that we cared about people dying of AIDS in Africa
 Our desire to be seen to be compassionate is what led us to commit this profoundly un-compassionate act
 As Meghan O'Gieblyn wrote in the Boston Review, "This isn't social justice
 It's a cathartic alternative
"
For the past three years, I've been going around the world meeting people like Justine Sacco -- and believe me, there's a lot of people like Justine Sacco
 There's more every day
 And we want to think they're fine, but they're not fine
 They talked to me about depression, and anxiety and insomnia and suicidal thoughts
 One woman I talked to, who also told a joke that landed badly, she stayed home for a year and a half
 Before that, she worked with adults with learning difficulties, and was apparently really good at her job
Justine was fired, of course, because social media demanded it
 But it was worse than that
 She was waking up in the middle of the night, forgetting who she was
 She was got because she was perceived to have misused her privilege
 And of course, that's a much better thing to get people for than the things we used to get people for, like having children out of wedlock
 But the phrase "misuse of privilege" is becoming a free pass to tear apart pretty much anybody we choose to
 It's becoming a devalued term, and it's making us lose our capacity for empathy and for distinguishing between serious and unserious transgressions
Justine had 170 Twitter followers, and so to make it work, she had to be fictionalized
 Word got around that she was the daughter the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco
 [Let us not be fooled by #JustineSacco her father is a SA mining billionaire
 She's not sorry
] I thought that was true about Justine, until I met her at a bar, and I asked her about her billionaire father, and she said, "My father sells carpets
"
And I think back on the early days of Twitter, when people would admit shameful secrets about themselves, and other people would say, "Oh my God, I'm exactly the same
" These days, the hunt is on for people's shameful secrets
 You can lead a good, ethical life, but some bad phraseology in a Tweet can overwhelm it all, become a clue to your secret inner evil
Maybe there's two types of people in the world: those people who favor humans over ideology, and those people who favor ideology over humans
 I favor humans over ideology, but right now, the ideologues are winning, and they're creating a stage for constant artificial high dramas where everybody's either a magnificent hero or a sickening villain, even though we know that's not true about our fellow humans
 The great thing about social media was how it gave a voice to voiceless people, but we're now creating a surveillance society, where the smartest way to survive is to go back to being voiceless
Let's not do that
Thank you
 Thank you, Jon
 Thanks, Bruno
 Don't go away
 In your book, you mention another story of another victim who actually got taken on by a reputation management firm, and by creating blogs and posting nice, innocuous stories about her love for cats and holidays and stuff, managed to get the story off the first couple pages of Google results, but it didn't last long
 A couple of weeks later, they started creeping back up to the top result
 You know, I think the very best thing we can do, if you see a kind of unfair or an ambiguous shaming, is to speak up, because I think the worst thing that happened to Justine was that nobody supported her -- like, everyone was against her, and that is profoundly traumatizing, to be told by tens of thousands of people that you need to get out
 But if a shaming happens and there's a babble of voices, like in a democracy, where people are discussing it, I think that's much less damaging
 So let's talk about your experience, because you stood up by writing this book
 By the way, it's mandatory reading for everybody, okay? You stood up because the book actually puts the spotlight on shamers
 And I assume you didn't only have friendly reactions on Twitter
 It didn't go down that well with some people
  I mean, you don't want to just concentrate -- because lots of people understood, and were really nice about the book
 But yeah, for 30 years I've been writing stories about abuses of power, and when I say the powerful people over there in the military, or in the pharmaceutical industry, everybody applauds me
 As soon as I say, "We are the powerful people abusing our power now," I get people saying, "Well you must be a racist too
"
 On one side you were talking with people around the table -- and that was a nice, constructive discussion
 On the other, every time you turned to your phone, there is this deluge of insults
 Yeah
 This happened last night
 We had like a TED dinner last night
 We were chatting and it was lovely and nice, and I decided to check Twitter
" And then I went back and had a nice conversation with somebody, and then I went back to Twitter, somebody said my very existence made the world a worse place
 Jon, thank you
 JR: Thank you, Bruno
So, people are more afraid of insects than they are of dying
 Only heights and public speaking exceeded the six-legged as sources of fear
 And I suspect if you had put spiders in there, the combinations of insects and spiders would have just topped the chart
 Now, I am not one of those people
 I really love insects
 I think they're interesting and beautiful, and sometimes even cute
  And I'm not alone
 For centuries, some of the greatest minds in science, from Charles Darwin to E
O
 Wilson, have drawn inspiration from studying some of the smallest minds on Earth
 Well, why is that? What is that keeps us coming back to insects? Some of it, of course, is just the sheer magnitude of almost everything about them
 They're more numerous than any other kind of animal
 We don't even know how many species of insects there are, because new ones are being discovered all the time
 There are at least a million, maybe as many as 10 million
 This means that you could have an insect-of-the-month calendar and not have to reuse a species for over 80,000 years
  Take that, pandas and kittens! 
 We need them
 Scientist use insects to make fundamental discoveries about everything from the structure of our nervous systems to how our genes and DNA work
 But what I love most about insects is what they can tell us about our own behavior
 Insects seem like they do everything that people do
 They meet, they mate, they fight, they break up
 And they do so with what looks like love or animosity
 But what drives their behaviors is really different than what drives our own, and that difference can be really illuminating
 There's nowhere where that's more true than when it comes to one of our most consuming interests -- sex
Now, I will maintain
 and I think I can defend, what may seem like a surprising statement
 I think sex in insects is more interesting than sex in people
  And the wild variety that we see makes us challenge some of our own assumptions about what it means to be male and female
 Female aphids can make little, tiny clones of themselves without ever mating
 Virgin birth, right there
 On your rose bushes
  When they do have sex, even their sperm is more interesting than human sperm
 There are some kinds of fruit flies whose sperm is longer than the male's own body
 And that's important because the males use their sperm to compete
 Now, male insects do compete with weapons, like the horns on these beetles
 But they also compete after mating with their sperm
 Dragonflies and damselflies have penises that look kind of like Swiss Army knives with all of the attachments pulled out
  They use these formidable devices like scoops, to remove the sperm from previous males that the female has mated with
  So, what can we learn from this?  All right, it is not a lesson in the sense of us imitating them or of them setting an example for us to follow
 Which, given this, is probably just as well
 And also, did I mention sexual cannibalism is rampant among insects? So, no, that's not the point
 So, people have this idea that nature dictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version of what males and females are like
 So that males are always supposed to be dominant and aggressive, and females are passive and coy
 So for example, take katydids, which are relatives of crickets and grasshoppers
 The males are very picky about who they mate with, because they not only transfer sperm during mating, they also give the female something called a nuptial gift
 You can see two katydids mating in these photos
 The white blob is the sperm, the green blob is the nuptial gift, and the male manufactures this from his own body and it's extremely costly to produce
 It can weigh up to a third of his body mass
 I will now pause for a moment and let you think about what it would be like if human men, every time they had sex, had to produce something that weighed 50, 60, 70 pounds
  Okay, they would not be able to do that very often
 And so what that means is the katydid males are very choosy about who they offer these nuptial gifts to
 Now, the gift is very nutritious, and the female eats it during and after mating
 So, the bigger it is, the better off the male is, because that means more time for his sperm to drain into her body and fertilize her eggs
 But it also means that the males are very passive about mating, whereas the females are extremely aggressive and competitive, in an attempt to get as many of these nutritious nuptial gifts as they can
 So, it's not exactly a stereotypical set of rules
 Even more generally though, males are actually not all that important in the lives of a lot of insects
 In the social insects -- the bees and wasps and ants -- the individuals that you see every day -- the ants going back and forth to your sugar bowl, the honey bees that are flitting from flower to flower -- all of those are always female
 People have had a hard time getting their head around that idea for millennia
 They hang around until the mating flight, but they don't participate in gathering nectar or pollen
 The Greeks couldn't figure out the drones' sex, and part of the confusion was that they were aware of the stinging ability of bees but they found it difficult to believe that any animals that bore such a weapon could possibly be a female
" Then he got confused, because that would have meant the males were also taking care of the young in a colony, and he seemed to think that would be completely impossible
 He then concluded that maybe bees had the organs of both sexes in the same individual, which is not that far-fetched, some animals do that, but he never really did get it figured out
 And you know, even today, my students, for instance, call every animal they see, including insects, a male
  And certainly all of the movies -- Antz, Bee Movie -- portray the main character in the social insects as being male
 Well, what difference does this make? These are movies
 They're fiction
 They have talking animals in them
 What difference does it make if they talk like Jerry Seinfeld? I think it does matter, and it's a problem that actually is part of a much deeper one that has implications for medicine and health and a lot of other aspects of our lives
 And the idea is that what's true for a person will also be true for the white rat
 And by and large, that turns out to be the case
 But you can take the idea of a model system too far
 And what I think we've done, is use males, in any species, as though they are the model system
 The norm
 The way things are supposed to be
 And females as a kind of variant -- something special that you only study after you get the basics down
 And so, back to the insects
 I think what that means is that people just couldn't see what was in front of them
 Because they assumed that the world's stage was largely occupied by male players and females would only have minor, walk-on roles
 But when we do that, we really miss out on a lot of what nature is like
 And we can also miss out on the way natural, living things, including people, can vary
 And I think that's why we've used males as models in a lot of medical research, something that we know now to be a problem if we want the results to apply to both men and women
 Well, the last thing I really love about insects is something that a lot of people find unnerving about them
 They have little, tiny brains with very little cognitive ability, the way we normally think of it
 They have complicated behavior, but they lack complicated brains
 And so, we can't just think of them as though they're little people because they don't do things the way that we do
 I really love that it's difficult to anthropomorphize insects, to look at them and just think of them like they're little people in exoskeletons, with six legs
  Instead, you really have to accept them on their own terms, because insects make us question what's normal and what's natural
 Now, you know, people write fiction and talk about parallel universes
 They speculate about the supernatural, maybe the spirits of the departed walking among us
 The allure of another world is something that people say is part of why they want to dabble in the paranormal
 But as far as I'm concerned, who needs to be able to see dead people, when you can see live insects? Thank you
 
 Isn't it nice?  The key phrase is "was," phew
 
Having brain cancer was really, as you can imagine, shocking news for me
 I knew nothing about cancer
 In Western cultures, when you have cancer, it's as if you disappear in a way
 Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data: Your images, your exams, your lab values, a list of medicines
 You suddenly become a disease on legs
 Doctors start speaking a language which you don't understand
 They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images
 People start changing as well because they start dealing with the disease, instead of with the human being
 They say, "What did the doctor say?" before even saying, "Hello
"
And in the meanwhile, you're left with questions to which nobody gives an answer
 These are the "Can I?" questions: Can I work while I have cancer? Can I study? Can I make love? Can I be creative? And you wonder, "What have I done to deserve this?" You wonder, "Can I change something about my lifestyle?" You wonder, "Can I do something? Are there any other options?"
And, obviously, doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios, because they are very professional and dedicated to curing you
 But they also are very used to having to deal with patients, so I'd say that they sometimes lose the idea that this is torture for you and that you become, literally, a patient -- "patient" means "the one who waits
"  Things are changing, but classically, they tend to not engage you in any way to learn about your condition, to get your friends and family engaged, or showing you ways in which you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you're going through
 But instead, you're forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional strangers
 It was really hard to obtain, because it's not common practice to ask for a picture of your own cancer
 I talked to it and I said, "Okay, cancer, you're not all there is to me
 A cure, whichever it is, will have to deal with the whole of me
 I was determined to change my relationship with the cancer and I was determined to learn more about my cancer before doing anything as drastic as a surgery
I'm an artist, I use several forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice
 So my best bet was to get it all out there, get the information out there, and use it so that it could be accessed by anyone
 So I created a website, which is called La Cura, on which I put my medical data, online
 I actually had to hack it and that's a thing which we can talk about in another speech
 In our Western cultures, it means eradicating or reversing a disease, but in different cultures, for example, a culture from Asia, from the Mediterranean, from Latin countries, from Africa, it can mean many more things
Of course, I was interested in the opinions of doctors and healthcare providers, but I was also interested in the cure of the artist, of the poet, of the designer, of, who knows, the musicians
 I was interested in the social cure, I was interested in the psychological cure, I was interested in the spiritual cure, I was interested in the emotional cure, I was interested in any form of cure
 For example, many thousands of videos, images, pictures, art performances were produced for La Cura
 Or, as artist Patrick Lichty has done: He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on Thingiverse
 Now you can have my cancer, too!  Which is a nice thing, if you think about it, we can share our cancer
And this was going on -- scientists, the traditional medicine experts, several researchers, doctors -- all connected with me to give advice
 With all this information and support, I was able to form a team of several neurosurgeons, traditional doctors, oncologists, and several hundred volunteers with whom I was able to discuss the information I was receiving, which is very important
 And together, we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many languages, according to many cultures
 And the current strategy spans the whole world and thousands of years of human history, which is quite remarkable for me
The follow-up MRIs showed, luckily, little to no growth of the cancer
 So I was able to take my time and choose
 Everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well, and this was the most important part of La Cura
What are the outcomes? I'm fine, as you can see, pretty fine
  I had excellent news after the surgery -- I have -- I had a very low-grade glioma, which is a "good" kind of cancer which doesn't grow a lot
 I have completely changed my life and my lifestyle
 Everything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged
Up until the very last few minutes of the surgery, which was very intense, a matrix of electrodes was implanted in my brain from this side, to be able to build a functional map of what the brain controls
 Obviously, there were
 [Open]
And this openness was really the fundamental part of La Cura
 Thousands of people shared their stories, their experiences
 I'm a self-founding, continuous state of translation among many different languages, in which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional research
 [Society]
 This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer
 And from what I feel, it's a cure for me, but for us all
 So about 10 years ago, I got a call from a woman in Texas, Stacey Baker, and she'd seen some of my photographs in an art exhibition and was wondering if she could commission me to take a portrait of her parents
 Now, at the time I hadn't met Stacey, and I thought this was some sort of wealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich, but it was only later that I found out she'd actually taken out a loan to make this happen
I took the picture of her parents, but I was actually more excited about photographing Stacey
 The picture I made that day ended up becoming one of my best-known portraits
 At the time I made this picture, Stacey was working as an attorney for the State of Texas
 Not long after, she left her job to study photography in Maine, and while she was there, she ended up meeting the director of photography at the New York Times Magazine and was actually offered a job
 Stacey Baker: In the years since, Alec and I have done a number of magazine projects together, and we've become friends
A few months ago, I started talking to Alec about a fascination of mine
 I've always been obsessed with how couples meet
 I asked Alec how he and his wife Rachel met, and he told me the story of a high school football game where she was 16 and he was 15, and he asked her out
 He liked her purple hair
 She said yes, and that was it
 I then asked Alec if he'd be interested in doing a photography project exploring this question
 And I was interested in the question, but I was actually much more interested in Stacey's motivation for asking it, particularly since I'd never known Stacey to have a boyfriend
 So my idea was to have Stacey here go speed dating in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day
   
 We ended up at what was advertised as the world's largest speed dating event
 I had 19 dates and each date lasted three minutes
 Participants were given a list of ice- breaker questions to get the ball rolling, things like, "If you could be any kind of animal, what would you be?" That sort of thing
My first date was Colin
 Alec and I saw him at the end of the evening, and he said he'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession stands
Zack and Chris came to the date-a-thon together
This is Carl
" 
Matthew is attracted to women with muscular calves
 He does triathlons, I run half-marathons
 Alec actually liked his eyes and asked if I was attracted to him, but I wasn't, and I don't think he was attracted to me either
Austin and Mike came together
 Mike asked me a hypothetical question
 He said, "You're in an elevator running late for a meeting
 Someone makes a dash for the elevator
 Do you hold it open for them?" And I said I would not
 
Cliff said the first thing he notices about a woman is her teeth, and we complimented each other's teeth
 Because he's an open mouth sleeper, he says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease, and so I asked him how often he flosses, and he said, "Every other day
"  Now, as someone who flosses twice a day, I wasn't really sure that that was flossing more but I don't think I said that out loud
 
The first thing Spencer notices about a woman is her complexion
 He feels a lot of women wear too much makeup, and that they should only wear enough to accentuate the features that they have
 I told him I didn't wear any makeup at all and he seemed to think that that was a good thing
 Craig told me he didn't think I was willing to be vulnerable
 He was also frustrated when I couldn't remember my most embarrassing moment
 He thought I was lying, but I wasn't
 I didn't think he liked me at all, but at the end of the night, he came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates
William was really difficult to talk to
 I think he was drunk
Actor Chris McKenna was the MC of the event
 He used to be on "The Young and the Restless
" I didn't actually go on a date with him
 Alec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him
Needless to say, I didn't fall in love
 I didn't feel a particular connection with any of the men that I went on dates with, and I didn't feel like they felt a particular connection with me either
 Now, the most beautiful thing to me --  -- as a photographer is the quality of vulnerability
 The physical exterior reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior
 At this date-a-thon event, I saw so many examples of that, but as I watched Stacey's dates and talked to her about them, I realized how different photographic love is from real love
What is real love? How does it work? In order to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes from meeting on a date to having a life together, Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin, which is the largest retirement community in Las Vegas
 Our contact there was George, who runs the community's photography club
 She met her husband when she was a 15-year-old waitress at a small barbecue place in Michigan
 He was 30
 She'd lied about her age
 He was the first person she'd dated
Dean had been named photographer of the year in Las Vegas two years in a row, and this caught Alec's attention, as did the fact that he met his wife, Judy, at the same age when Alec met Rachel
 Dean admitted that he likes to look at beautiful women, but he's never questioned his decision to marry Judy
 George met Josephine at a parish dance
 He was 18, she was 15
 Like a lot of the couples we met, they weren't especially philosophical about their early choices
 George said something that really stuck with me
 He said, "When you get that feeling, you just go with it
"
Bob and Trudy met on a blind date when she was still in high school
 They said they weren't particularly attracted to each other when the first met
 Nevertheless, they were married soon after
 This was George and Mary's second marriage
 He was there alone drinking and she was with friends
 When they started dating, he owed the IRS 9,000 dollars in taxes, and she offered to help him get out of debt, so for the next year, he turned his paychecks over to Mary, and she got him out of debt
 George was actually an alcoholic when they married, and Mary knew it
 Another time, when he was drunk, he threatened to kill Mary and her two kids, but they escaped and a SWAT team was called to the house
 Amazingly, Mary took him back, and eventually things got better
 George has been involved in Alcoholics Anonymous and hasn't had a drink in 36 years
 They all had this beautiful quality of endurance, but that was true of the singles, too
 The world is hard, and the singles were out there trying to connect with other people, and the couples were holding onto each other after all these decades
My favorite pictures on this trip were of Joe and Roseanne
 Now, by the time we met Joe and Roseanne, we'd gotten in the habit of asking couples if they had an old wedding photograph
 In their case, they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets the exact same photograph
Thank you
It was the middle of summer and well past closing time in the downtown Berkeley bar where my friend Polly and I worked together as bartenders
 Usually at the end of our shift we had a drink -- but not that night
 "I'm pregnant
 Not sure what I'm going to do yet," I told Polly
 Without hesitation, she replied, "I've had an abortion
" Before Polly, no one had ever told me that she'd had an abortion
 When I thought about my choices, I honestly did not know how to decide, what criteria I should use
 How would I know what the right decision was? I worried that I would regret an abortion later
 I was born in a trailer on the third anniversary of Roe vs
 Wade
 Our community was surfing Christians
 We cared about God, the less fortunate, and the ocean
 Everyone was pro-life
 As a kid, the idea of abortion made me so sad that I knew if I ever got pregnant I could never have one
 And then I did
 But Polly had given me a very special gift: the knowledge that I wasn't alone and the realization that abortion was something that we can talk about
 Abortion is common
 But for the last few decades, the dialogue around abortion in the United States has left little room for anything beyond pro-life and pro-choice
 It's political and polarizing
But as much as abortion is hotly debated, it's still rare for us, whether as fellow women or even just as fellow people, to talk with one another about the abortions that we have
 There is a gap
 Between what happens in politics and what happens in real life, and in that gap, a battlefield mentality
 An "are you with us or against us?" stance takes root
 This isn't just about abortion
 And so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation is the work of my life
 There are two main ways to get started
 One way is to listen closely
 And the other way is to share stories
 So, 15 years ago, I cofounded an organization called Exhale to start listening to people who have had abortions
 The first thing we did was create a talk-line, where women and men could call to get emotional support
 Free of judgment and politics, believe it or not, nothing like our sevice had ever existed
 We needed a new framework that could hold all the experiences that we were hearing on our talk-line
 The feminist who regrets her abortion
 The Catholic who is grateful for hers
 The personal experiences that weren't fitting neatly into one box or the other
 We didn't think it was right to ask women to pick a side
 We wanted to show them that the whole world was on their side, as they were going through this deeply personal experience
 So we invented "pro-voice
"
 It also works on deeply personal topics that might only matter to you and your immediate family and friends
 They have a terminal illness, their mother just died, they have a child with special needs and they can't talk about it
 Listening and storytelling are the hallmarks of pro-voice practice
 Listening and storytelling
 That sounds pretty nice
 Sounds maybe, easy? We could all do that
 It's not easy
 It's very hard
 Pro-voice is hard because we are talking about things everyone's fighting about or the things that no one wants to talk about
 I wish I could tell you that there would be a feminist welcoming party for you, or that there's a long-lost sisterhood of people who are just ready to have your back when you get slammed
 But it can be vulnerable and exhausting to tell our own stories when it feels like nobody cares
 And if we truly listen to one another, we will hear things that demand that we shift our own perceptions
 There is no perfect time and there is no perfect place to start a difficult conversation
 One is to ask open-ended questions
 You can ask yourself or someone that you know, "How are you feeling?" "What was that like?" "What do you hope for, now?" Another way to be a good listener is to use reflective language
 If someone is talking about their own personal experience, use the words that they use
 If someone is talking about an abortion and they say the word "baby," you can say "baby
" If someone describes themselves as gender queer to you, you can say "gender queer
" If someone kind of looks like a he, but they say they're a she -- it's cool
 Call that person a she
 When we reflect the language of the person who is sharing their own story, we are conveying that we are interested in understanding who they are and what they're going through
 So, I'll never forget being in one of the Exhale counselor meetings, listening to a volunteer talk about how she was getting a lot of calls from Christian women who were talking about God
 Now, some of our volunteers are religious, but this particular one was not
 At first, it felt a little weird for her to talk to callers about God
 So, she decided to get comfortable
" "God
" "God
" "God
" "God
" Over and over and over again until the word no longer felt strange coming out her mouth
 So, another way to be pro-voice is to share stories, and one risk that you take on, when you share your story with someone else, is that given the same set of circumstances as you they might actually make a different decision
 For example, if you're telling a story about your abortion, realize that she might have had the baby
 She might have placed for adoption
 She might have told her parents and her partner -- or not
 She might have felt relief and confidence, even though you felt sad and lost
 This is okay
 Empathy gets created the moment we imagine ourselves in someone else's shoes
 It's not agreement, it's not sameness that pro-voice is after
 It creates a culture and a society that values what make us special and unique
 It values what makes us human, our flaws and our imperfections
 And this way of thinking allows us to see our differences with respect, instead of fear
 Stigma, shame, prejudice, discrimination, oppression
 Pro-voice is contagious, and the more it's practiced the more it spreads
 So, last year I was pregnant again
 And while pregnant, I had never been asked how I was feeling so much in all my life
  And however I replied, whether I was feeling wonderful and excited or scared and totally freaked out, there was always someone there giving me a "been there" response
 It was awesome
 Pro-voice is about the real stories of real people making an impact on the way abortion and so many other politicized and stigmatized issues are understood and discussed
 From sexuality and mental health to poverty and incarceration
 Far beyond definition as single right or wrong decisions, our experiences can exist on a spectrum
 Pro-voice focuses that conversation on human experience and it makes support and respect possible for all
 Thank you
 
About 10 years ago, I went through a little bit of a hard time
 I had been seeing her for a few months, when she looked at me one day and said, "Who actually raised you until you were three?" Seemed like a weird question
 I said, "My parents
" And she said, "I don't think that's actually the case; because if it were, we'd be dealing with things that are far more complicated than just this
"
It sounded like the setup to a joke, but I knew she was serious
 Because when I first started seeing her, I was trying to be the funniest person in the room
 And I would try and crack these jokes, but she caught on to me really quickly, and whenever I tried to make a joke, she would look at me and say, "That is actually really sad
"  It's terrible
So I knew I had to be serious, and I asked my parents who had actually raised me until I was three? And to my surprise, they said my primary caregiver had been a distant relative of the family
 I had called her my auntie
I remember my auntie so clearly, it felt like she had been part of my life when I was much older
 I remember the thick, straight hair, and how it would come around me like a curtain when she bent to pick me up; her soft, southern Thai accent; the way I would cling to her, even if she just wanted to go to the bathroom or get something to eat
 I loved her, but [with] the ferocity that a child has sometimes before she understands that love also requires letting go
But my clearest and sharpest memory of my auntie, is also one of my first memories of life at all
 I remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family
 I remember screaming hysterically and wanting it to stop, as I did every single time it happened, for things as minor as wanting to go out with her friends, or being a little late
Things got so bad for her that eventually she ran away
 As an adult, I learned later that she had been just 19 when she was brought over from Thailand to the States to care for me, on a tourist visa
 I clung to her again, as I had when I was a child, and I let go, and then I promised that I would call
 I never did, though
 Because I was afraid if I said everything that she meant to me -- that I owed perhaps the best parts of who I became to her care, and that the words "I'm sorry" were like a thimble to bail out all the guilt and shame and rage I felt over everything she had endured to care for me for as long as she had -- I thought if I said those words to her, I would never stop crying again
 Because she had saved me
 And I had not saved her
I'm a journalist, and I've been writing and researching human trafficking for the past eight years or so, and even so, I never put together this personal story with my professional life until pretty recently
 I think this profound disconnect actually symbolizes most of our understanding about human trafficking
 Because human trafficking is far more prevalent, complex and close to home than most of us realize
 And when I think about what we've done about human trafficking, I am hugely disappointed
 Partly because we don't even talk about the problem right at all
 When I say "human trafficking," most of you probably don't think about someone like my auntie
 That is real suffering, and that is a real story
 That story makes me angry for far more than just the reality of that situation, though
 We use that story to convince ourselves that human trafficking is a bad man doing a bad thing to an innocent girl
 That story lets us off the hook
 It takes away all the societal context that we might be indicted for, for the structural inequality, or the poverty, or the barriers to migration
 We let ourselves think that human trafficking is only about forced prostitution, when in reality, human trafficking is embedded in our everyday lives
Let me show you what I mean
 Forced prostitution accounts for 22 percent of human trafficking
 Ten percent is in state- imposed forced labor
 Human trafficking is the use of force, fraud or coercion to compel another person's labor
 And it's found in cotton fields, and coltan mines, and even car washes in Norway and England
S
 That country has become the largest exporter of shrimp in the world
 But what are the circumstances behind all that cheap and plentiful shrimp? Thai military were caught selling Burmese and Cambodian migrants onto fishing boats
 Those fishing boats were taken out, the men put to work, and they were thrown overboard if they made the mistake of falling sick, or trying to resist their treatment
 Those fish were then used to feed shrimp, The shrimp were then sold to four major global retailers: Costco, Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour
Human trafficking is found on a smaller scale than just that, and in places you would never even imagine
 Traffickers have forced young people to drive ice cream trucks, or to sing in touring boys' choirs
 Trafficking has even been found in a hair braiding salon in New Jersey
The scheme in that case was incredible
 The traffickers found young families who were from Ghana and Togo, and they told these families that "your daughters are going to get a fine education in the United States
" They then located winners of the green card lottery, and they told them, "We'll help you out
 We'll get you a plane ticket
 All you have to do is take this young girl with you, say that she's your sister or your spouse
 Once everyone arrived in New Jersey, the young girls were taken away, and put to work for 14-hour days, seven days a week, for five years
 They made their traffickers nearly four million dollars
 So what have we done about it? We've mostly turned to the criminal justice system
 But keep in mind, most victims of human trafficking are poor and marginalized
 They're migrants, people of color
 Sometimes they're in the sex trade
 And for populations like these, the criminal justice system is too often part of the problem, rather than the solution
 In study after study, in countries ranging from Bangladesh to the United States, between 20 and 60 percent of the people in the sex trade who were surveyed said that they had been raped or assaulted by the police in the past year alone
 People in prostitution, including people who have been trafficked into it, regularly receive multiple convictions for prostitution
 Having that criminal record makes it so much more difficult to leave poverty, leave abuse, or leave prostitution, if that person so desires
 Workers outside of the sex sector -- if they try and resist their treatment, they risk deportation
 In case after case I've studied, employers have no problem calling on law enforcement to try and threaten or deport their striking trafficked workers
Law enforcement is supposed to identify victims and prosecute traffickers
 But out of an estimated 21 million victims of human trafficking in the world, they have helped and identified fewer than 50,000 people
 Keep in mind that labor trafficking accounts for 68 percent of all trafficking, but fewer than 10 percent of the convictions
 I'd like to add one more element to that
 Trafficking happens in sectors where workers are excluded from protections, and denied the right to organize
 Trafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum
 Let me tell you what that looks like
I spent many months researching a trafficking case called Global Horizons, involving hundreds of Thai farm workers
 They were sent all over the States, to work in Hawaii pineapple plantations, and Washington apple orchards, and anywhere the work was needed
 They were promised three years of solid agricultural work
 So they made a calculated risk
 They sold their land, they sold their wives' jewelry, to make thousands in recruitment fees for this company, Global Horizons
 But once they were brought over, their passports were confiscated
 Some of the men were beaten and held at gunpoint
 They worked so hard they fainted in the fields
 This case hit me so hard
After I came back home, I was wandering through the grocery store, and I froze in the produce department
 I was remembering the over-the-top meals the Global Horizons survivors would make for me every time I showed up to interview them
 They finished one meal with this plate of perfect, long-stemmed strawberries, and as they handed them to me, they said, "Aren't these the kind of strawberries you eat with somebody special in the States? And don't they taste so much better when you know the people whose hands picked them for you?"
As I stood in that grocery store weeks later, I realized I had no idea of who to thank for this plenty, and no idea of how they were being treated
 So, like the journalist I am, I started digging into the agricultural sector
 And I found there are too many fields, and too few labor inspectors
 The Global Horizons survivors had been brought to the States on a temporary guest worker program
 That guest worker program ties a person's legal status to his or her employer, and denies that worker the right to organize
 Mind you, none of what I am describing about this agricultural sector or the guest worker program is actually human trafficking
 It is merely what we find legally tolerable
 And all of this had been hidden to me, before I had tried to understand it
I wasn't the only person grappling with these issues
 Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, is one of the biggest anti-trafficking philanthropists in the world
 And even he wound up accidentally investing nearly 10 million dollars in the pineapple plantation cited as having the worst working conditions in that Global Horizons case
 When he found out, he and his wife were shocked and horrified, and they wound up writing an op-ed for a newspaper, saying that it was up to all of us to learn everything we can about the labor and supply chains of the products that we support
What would happen if each one of us decided that we are no longer going to support companies if they don't eliminate exploitation from their labor and supply chains? If we demanded laws calling for the same? If all the CEOs out there decided that they were going to go through their businesses and say, "no more"? If we ended recruitment fees for migrant workers? If we decided that guest workers should have the right to organize without fear of retaliation? These would be decisions heard around the world
 That's not how it works
We often dwell on human trafficking survivors' victimization
 But that is not my experience of them
 Over all the years that I've been talking to them, they have taught me that we are more than our worst days
 Each one of us is more than what we have lived through
 Especially trafficking survivors
 These people were the most resourceful and resilient and responsible in their communities
 They were the people that you would take a gamble on
 You'd say, I'm gong to sell my rings, because I have the chance to send you off to a better future
These survivors don't need saving
 The nannies and housekeepers who marched with their families and their employers' families -- their activism got us an international treaty on domestic workers' rights
 The Nepali women who were trafficked into the sex trade -- they came together, and they decided that they were going to make the world's first anti-trafficking organization actually headed and run by trafficking survivors themselves
 These Indian shipyard workers were trafficked to do post-Hurricane Katrina reconstruction
 They were threatened with deportation, but they broke out of their work compound and they marched from New Orleans to Washington, D
, to protest labor exploitation
 They cofounded an organization called the National Guest Worker Alliance, and through this organization, they have wound up helping other workers bring to light exploitation and abuses in supply chains in Walmart and Hershey's factories
 And although the Department of Justice declined to take their case, a team of civil rights lawyers won the first of a dozen civil suits this February, and got their clients 14 million dollars
These survivors are fighting for people they don't even know yet, other workers, and for the possibility of a just world for all of us
 This is our chance to do the same
 This is our chance to make the decision that tells us who we are, as a people and as a society; that our prosperity is no longer prosperity, as long as it is pinned to other people's pain; that our lives are inextricably woven together; and that we have the power to make a different choice
I was so reluctant to share my story of my auntie with you
 Before I started this TED process and climbed up on this stage, I had told literally a handful of people about it, because, like many a journalist, I am far more interested in learning about your stories than sharing much, if anything, about my own
 I also haven't done my journalistic due diligence on this
 I don't know her story of what happened, and of her life now
 The story as I've told it to you is messy and unfinished
 But I think it mirrors the messy and unfinished situation we're all in, when it comes to human trafficking
 We are all implicated in this problem
 But that means we are all also part of its solution
 Figuring out how to build a more just world is our work to do, and our story to tell
 So let us tell it the way we should have done, from the very beginning
 Let us tell this story together
This summer I was back in Ohio for a family wedding, and when I was there, there was a meet and greet with Anna and Elsa from "Frozen
" Not the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen," as this was not a Disney-sanctioned event
 These two entrepreneurs had a business of running princess parties
 Your kid is turning five? They'll come sing some songs, sprinkle some fairy dust, it's great
 And they were not about to miss out on the opportunity that was the phenomenon and that was "Frozen
"
So they get hired by a local toy store, kids come in on a Saturday morning, buy some Disney swag, get their picture taken with the princesses, call it a day
 It's like Santa Claus without the seasonal restrictions
 
And my three-and-a-half-year-old niece Samantha was in the thick of it
"
 We get there at 10 o'clock, the scheduled start time, and we are handed number 59
 
30 we get called: "56 to 63, please
" And as we walk in, it is a scene I can only describe you as saying it looked like Norway threw up
And as we stood in line in an attempt to give my niece a better vantage point than the backside of the mother of number 58, I put her up on my shoulders, and she was instantly riveted by the sight of the princesses
 And as we moved forward, her excitement only grew, and as we finally got to the front of the line, and number 58 unfurled her poster to be signed by the princesses, I could literally feel the excitement running through her body
 And let's be honest, at that point, I was pretty excited too
  I mean, the Scandinavian decadence was mesmerizing
So we get to the front of the line, and the haggard clerk turns to my niece and says, "Hi, honey
 You're next! Do you want to get down, or you're going to stay on your dad's shoulders for the picture?'  And I was, for a lack of a better word, frozen
 
It's amazing that in an unexpected instant we are faced with the question, who am I? Am I an aunt? Or am I an advocate? Millions of people have seen my video about how to have a hard conversation, and there one was, right in front of me
 At the same time, there's nothing more important to me than the kids in my life, so I found myself in a situation that we so often find ourselves in, torn between two things, two impossible choices
 Or would I be an aunt? Would I brush off that comment, take a million pictures, and not be distracted for an instant from the pure joy of that moment, and by doing that, walk out with the shame that comes up for not standing up for myself, especially in front of my niece
Who was I? Which one was more important? Which role was more worth it? Was I an aunt? Or was I an advocate? And I had a split second to decide
We are taught right now that we are living in a world of constant and increasing polarity
 It's so black and white, so us and them, so right and wrong
 There is no middle, there is no gray, just polarity
 Polarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions are completely opposite from each other; a diametrical opposition
 That is polarity
The problem with polarity and absolutes is that it eliminates the individuality of our human experience and that makes it contradictory to our human nature
 But if we are pulled in these two directions, but it's not really where we exist -- polarity is not our actual reality -- where do we go from there? What's at the other end of that spectrum?
I don't think it's an unattainable, harmonious utopia, I think the opposite of polarity is duality
 Duality is a state of having two parts, but not in diametrical opposition, in simultaneous existence
 Don't think it's possible? Here are the people I know: I know Catholics who are pro-choice, and feminists who wear hijabs, and veterans who are antiwar, and NRA members who think I should be able to get married
 Those are the people I know, those are my friends and family, that is the majority of our society, that is you, that is me
  Duality is the ability to hold both things
 But the question is: Can we own our duality? Can we have the courage to hold both things?
 I was a server and we had a great relationship, we had a really great time together
 Her Spanish was great because she was from Mexico
  That line actually went the other way
 Her English was limited, but significantly better than my Spanish
 But we were united by our similarities, not separated by our differences
 And we were close, even though we came from very different worlds
 She was from Mexico, she left her family behind so she could come here and afford them a better life back home
 She was a devout conservative Catholic, a believer in traditional family values, stereotypical roles of men and women, and I was, well, me
 
But the things that bonded us were when she asked about my girlfriend, or she shared pictures that she had from her family back home
 Those were the things that brought us together
 So one day, we were in the back, scarfing down food as quickly as we could, gathered around a small table, during a very rare lull, and a new guy from the kitchen came over -- who happened to be her cousin -- and sat down with all the bravado and machismo that his 20-year-old body could hold
" And he said, [in Spanish] "A girlfriend?!?" And she set down her fork, and locked eyes with him, and said, [in Spanish] "Yes, a girlfriend
" And his smug smile quickly dropped to one of maternal respect, grabbed his plate, walked off, went back to work
 She left, did the same thing -- it was a 10-second conversation, such a short interaction
And on paper, she had so much more in common with him: language, culture, history, family, her community was her lifeline here, but her moral compass trumped all of that
 And a little bit later, they were joking around in the kitchen in Spanish, that had nothing to do with me, and that is duality
 She didn't have to choose some P
C
 stance on gayness over her heritage
 She didn't have to choose her family over our friendship
 It wasn't Jesus or Ash
  
 Our moral integrity is our responsibility and we must be prepared to defend it even when it's not convenient
 That's what it means to be an ally, and if you're going to be an ally, you have to be an active ally: Ask questions, act when you hear something inappropriate, actually engage
I had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover
 Really? Lover? So overly sexual, so '70s gay porn
  But she was trying, and she asked
 She could have called her my friend, or my "friend," or my "special friend" --  -- or even worse, just not asked at all
 Believe me, we would rather have you ask
 I would rather have her say lover, than say nothing at all
People often say to me, "Well, Ash, I don't care
 It doesn't matter to me
 I don't see it
 If you don't see my gayness, then you don't see me
 If it doesn't matter to you who I sleep with, then you cannot imagine what it feels like when I walk down the street late at night holding her hand, and approach a group of people and have to make the decision if I should hang on to it or if I should I drop it when all I want to do is squeeze it tighter
 And the small victory I feel when I make it by and don't have to let go
 And the incredible cowardice and disappointment I feel when I drop it
 If you do not see that struggle that is unique to my human experience because I am gay, then you don't see me
 If you are going to be an ally, I need you to see me
 You don't learn how to hold two things just from the fluff, you learn it from the grit
We are complex individuals, swirls of contradiction
 You are all holding so many things right now
 What can you do to hold just a few more?
 I'm at the front of the line, niece on my shoulders, the frazzled clerk calls me Dad
 Have you ever been mistaken for the wrong gender? Not even that
 Have you ever been called something you are not? Here's what it feels like for me: I am instantly an internal storm of contrasting emotions
 I break out into a sweat that is a combination of rage and humiliation, I feel like the entire store is staring at me, and I simultaneously feel invisible
 I want to explode in a tirade of fury, and I want to crawl under a rock
  But, despite my best efforts to be seen as the gender I am, it still happens
 I am accustomed to this familiar hurt, but I will do whatever I need to do to protect the people I love from it
But then I take my niece off my shoulders, and she runs to Elsa and Anna -- the thing she's been waiting so long for -- and all that stuff goes away
 All that matters is the smile on her face
 And as the 30 seconds we waited two and a half hours for comes to a close we gather up our things, and I lock eyes with the clerk again; and she gives me an apologetic smile and mouths, "I am so sorry!"  And her humanity, her willingness to admit her mistake disarms me immediately, then I give her a: "It's okay, it happens
 But thanks
And I realize in that moment that I don't have to be either an aunt or an advocate, I can be both
 I can live in duality, and I can hold two things
 And if I can hold two things in that environment, I can hold so many more things
"  "It was even worth you getting called Dad
"  And for the first time ever in my life, it actually was
Thank you, Boulder
 Have a good night
One of my earliest memories is of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to
 And I was just a little kid, so I didn't really understand why, but as I got older, I realized we had drug addiction in my family, including later cocaine addiction
I'd been thinking about it a lot lately, partly because it's now exactly 100 years since drugs were first banned in the United States and Britain, and we then imposed that on the rest of the world
 It's a century since we made this really fateful decision to take addicts and punish them and make them suffer, because we believed that would deter them; it would give them an incentive to stop
And a few years ago, I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love, and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them
So I read loads of stuff about it, and I couldn't really find the answers I was looking for, so I thought, okay, I'll go and sit with different people around the world who lived this and studied this and talk to them and see if I could learn from them
 And the thing I realized that really blew my mind is, almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong, and if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction, I think we're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies
But let's start with what we think we know, what I thought I knew
 Let's think about this middle row here
 Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, went off and used heroin three times a day
 Some of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect
  Don't worry, it's just a thought experiment
 Imagine you did that, right? What would happen? Now, we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century
 We think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin, as you took it for a while, your body would become dependent on those hooks, you'd start to physically need them, and at the end of those 20 days, you'd all be heroin addicts
 Right? That's what I thought
 If I step out of this TED Talk today and I get hit by a car and I break my hip, I'll be taken to hospital and I'll be given loads of diamorphine
 Diamorphine is heroin
 It's actually much better heroin than you're going to buy on the streets, because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated
 Actually, very little of it is heroin, whereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure
 And you'll be given it for quite a long period of time
 There are loads of people in this room, you may not realize it, you've taken quite a lot of heroin
 And anyone who is watching this anywhere in the world, this is happening
 And if what we believe about addiction is right -- those people are exposed to all those chemical hooks -- What should happen? They should become addicts
 This has been studied really carefully
 It doesn't happen; you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement, she didn't come out as a junkie
 
And when I learned this, it seemed so weird to me, so contrary to everything I'd been told, everything I thought I knew, I just thought it couldn't be right, until I met a man called Bruce Alexander
 He's a professor of psychology in Vancouver who carried out an incredible experiment I think really helps us to understand this issue
 Professor Alexander explained to me, the idea of addiction we've all got in our heads, that story, comes partly from a series of experiments that were done earlier in the 20th century
 They're really simple
 You can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic
 You get a rat and you put it in a cage, and you give it two water bottles: One is just water, and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine
 In the '70s, Professor Alexander comes along and he looks at this experiment and he noticed something
 It's got nothing to do except use these drugs
 So Professor Alexander built a cage that he called "Rat Park," which is basically heaven for rats
 Crucially, they've got loads of friends
 They can have loads of sex
 And they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drugged water
 But here's the fascinating thing: In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water
 They almost never use it
 None of them ever use it compulsively
 None of them ever overdose
 You go from almost 100 percent overdose when they're isolated to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives
 In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin, and if you look at the news reports from the time, they were really worried, because they thought, my God, we're going to have hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the United States when the war ends; it made total sense
 Now, those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home
 The Archives of General Psychiatry did a really detailed study, and what happened to them? It turns out they didn't go to rehab
 They didn't go into withdrawal
 Now, if you believe the story about chemical hooks, that makes absolutely no sense, but Professor Alexander began to think there might be a different story about addiction
 He said, what if addiction isn't about your chemical hooks? What if addiction is about your cage? What if addiction is an adaptation to your environment?
 Maybe we should call it bonding
 Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond, and when we're happy and healthy, we'll bond and connect with each other, but if you can't do that, because you're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life, you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief
 Now, that might be gambling, that might be pornography, that might be cocaine, that might be cannabis, but you will bond and connect with something because that's our nature
 That's what we want as human beings
And at first, I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around, but one way that helped me to think about it is, I can see, I've got over by my seat a bottle of water, right? I'm looking at lots of you, and lots of you have bottles of water with you
 Forget the drugs
 Forget the drug war
 Totally legally, all of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka, right? We could all be getting drunk -- I might after this --  -- but we're not
 Now, because you've been able to afford the approximately gazillion pounds that it costs to get into a TED Talk, I'm guessing you guys could afford to be drinking vodka for the next six months
 You wouldn't end up homeless
 You're not going to do that, and the reason you're not going to do that is not because anyone's stopping you
 It's because you've got bonds and connections that you want to be present for
 You've got work you love
 You've got people you love
 You've got healthy relationships
 And a core part of addiction, I came to think, and I believe the evidence suggests, is about not being able to bear to be present in your life
Now, this has really significant implications
 The most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs
 In Arizona, I went out with a group of women who were made to wear t-shirts saying, "I was a drug addict," and go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public jeer at them, and when those women get out of prison, they're going to have criminal records that mean they'll never work in the legal economy again
 We punish them
 We give them criminal records
 We put barriers between them reconnecting
 There was a doctor in Canada, Dr
Now, there's a place that decided to do the exact opposite, and I went there to see how it worked
 In the year 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe
 One percent of the population was addicted to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing, and every year, they tried the American way more and more
 They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more, and every year, the problem got worse
 And one day, the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition got together, and basically said, look, we can't go on with a country where we're having ever more people becoming heroin addicts
 Let's set up a panel of scientists and doctors to figure out what would genuinely solve the problem
 And they set up a panel led by an amazing man called Dr
" And that's not really what we think of as drug treatment in the United States and Britain
 So they do do residential rehab, they do psychological therapy, that does have some value
 When you're ready, they'll go to a garage, and they'll say, if you employ this guy for a year, we'll pay half his wages
 The goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal had something to get out of bed for in the morning
It'll be 15 years this year since that experiment began, and the results are in: injecting drug use is down in Portugal, according to the British Journal of Criminology, by 50 percent, five-zero percent
 Overdose is massively down, HIV is massively down among addicts
 Addiction in every study is significantly down
 One of the ways you know it's worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal wants to go back to the old system
 I actually think there's a layer of implications to all this research below that
 We live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable to all sorts of addictions, whether it's to their smartphones or to shopping or to eating
 Before these talks began -- you guys know this -- we were told we weren't allowed to have our smartphones on, and I have to say, a lot of you looked an awful lot like addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable for the next couple of hours
  A lot of us feel like that, and it might sound weird to say, I've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction and weird to say it's growing, because you think we're the most connected society that's ever been, surely
 But I increasingly began to think that the connections we have or think we have, are like a kind of parody of human connection
 If you have a crisis in your life, you'll notice something
 It won't be your Twitter followers who come to sit with you
 It won't be your Facebook friends who help you turn it round
 It'll be your flesh and blood friends who you have deep and nuanced and textured, face-to-face relationships with, and there's a study I learned about from Bill McKibben, the environmental writer, that I think tells us a lot about this
 He looked at the number of close friends the average American believes they can call on in a crisis
 That number has been declining steadily since the 1950s
 The amount of floor space an individual has in their home has been steadily increasing, and I think that's like a metaphor for the choice we've made as a culture
 We've traded floorspace for friends, we've traded stuff for connections, and the result is we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been
 And Bruce Alexander, the guy who did the Rat Park experiment, says, we talk all the time in addiction about individual recovery, and it's right to talk about that, but we need to talk much more about social recovery
If I'm honest, this isn't why I went into it
 I didn't go in to the discover the political stuff, the social stuff
 I wanted to know how to help the people I love
 And when I came back from this long journey and I'd learned all this, I looked at the addicts in my life, and if you're really candid, it's hard loving an addict, and there's going to be lots of people who know in this room
 And the kind of scripts we're told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives is typified by, I think, the reality show "Intervention," if you guys have ever seen it
 I think everything in our lives is defined by reality TV, but that's another TED Talk
 If you've ever seen the show "Intervention," it's a pretty simple premise
 So what they do is they take the connection to the addict, and they threaten it, they make it contingent on the addict behaving the way they want
 And I began to think, I began to see why that approach doesn't work, and I began to think that's almost like the importing of the logic of the Drug War into our private lives
So I was thinking, how could I be Portuguese? And what I've tried to do now, and I can't tell you I do it consistently and I can't tell you it's easy, is to say to the addicts in my life that I want to deepen the connection with them, to say to them, I love you whether you're using or you're not
 I love you, whatever state you're in, and if you need me, I'll come and sit with you because I love you and I don't want you to be alone or to feel alone
And I think the core of that message -- you're not alone, we love you -- has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts, socially, politically and individually
 For 100 years now, we've been singing war songs about addicts
 I think all along we should have been singing love songs to them, because the opposite of addiction is not sobriety
 The opposite of addiction is connection
Thank you
I'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi, Eileen Piri
 Eileen is only 13 years old, but when we were going through the collection of poetry that we wrote, I found her poem so interesting, so motivating
 She entitled her poem "I'll Marry When I Want
" 
"I'll marry when I want
 My mother can't force me to marry
 My uncle, my aunt, my brother or sister, cannot force me to marry
 Even if you beat me, even if you chase me away, even if you do anything bad to me, I'll marry when I want
I'll marry when I want, but not before I am well educated, and not before I am all grown up
I'll marry when I want
This poem might seem odd, written by a 13-year-old girl, but where I and Eileen come from, this poem, which I have just read to you, is a warrior's cry
 Malawi is one of the poorest countries, very poor, where gender equality is questionable
Growing up in that country, I couldn't make my own choices in life
 I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life
I will tell you a story of two different girls, two beautiful girls
 These girls grew up under the same roof
 They were eating the same food
 Sometimes, they would share clothes, and even shoes
 But their lives ended up differently, in two different paths
 The other girl is my little sister
 My little sister was only 11 years old when she got pregnant
 Not only did it hurt her, even me
 I was going through a hard time as well
As it is in my culture, once you reach puberty stage, you are supposed to go to initiation camps
 There is this special day, which they call "Very Special Day" where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls
 Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day
 They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases
For my little sister, she ended up being pregnant
On the other side, there is this girl
 She's amazing
 She's very fabulous
 That girl is me
  When I was 13 years old, I was told, you are grown up, you have now reached of age, you're supposed to go to the initiation camp
 I was like, "What? I'm not going to go to the initiation camps
" You know what the women said to me? "You are a stupid girl
 Stubborn
 You do not respect the traditions of our society, of our community
"
I said no because I knew where I was going
 I had a lot of dreams as a young girl
 I wanted to get well educated, to find a decent job in the future
 I was imagining myself as a lawyer, seated on that big chair
 Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day
 And I knew that one day, I would contribute something, a little something to my community
 But every day after refusing, women would tell me, "Look at you, you're all grown up
 What about you?" That was the music that I was hearing every day, and that is the music that girls hear every day when they don't do something that the community needs them to do
That was when I called other girls just like my sister, who have children, who have been in class but they have forgotten how to read and write
 I said, "Come on, we can remind each other how to read and write again, how to hold the pen, how to read, to hold the book
" It was a great time I had with them
 Nor did I just learn a little about them, but they were able to tell me their personal stories, what they were facing every day as young mothers
 That was when I was like, 'Why can't we take all these things that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers, our traditional leaders, that these are the wrong things?" It was a scary thing to do, because these traditional leaders, they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages
 A hard thing to change, but a good thing to try
 
In my community, that was the first time a community, they had to call the bylaws, the first bylaw that protected girls in our community
 We forged ahead
 We were determined to fight for girls not just in my community, but even in other communities
 When the child marriage bill was being presented in February, we were there at the Parliament house
 So we said, "Why can't we get their numbers and text them?" So we did that
 It was a good thing
  So when the bill passed, we texted them back, "Thank you for supporting the bill
"  And when the bill was signed by the president, making it into law, it was a plus
 Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal marriage age, from 15 to 18
 
It's a good thing to know that the bill passed, but let me tell you this: There are countries where 18 is the legal marriage age, but don't we hear cries of women and girls every day? Every day, girls' lives are being wasted away
 We don't have to be subjected as second, but they have to know that women, as we are in this room, we are not just women, we are not just girls, we are extraordinary
 We can do more
And another thing for Malawi, and not just Malawi but other countries: The laws which are there, you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced? The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries have been there, they need to be publicized at the local level, at the community level, where girls' issues are very striking
 Girls face issues, difficult issues, at the community level every day
 So if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them, they will be able to stand up and defend themselves because they will know that there is a law that protects them
 Male advocates, they have to jump in, to step in and work together
 It's a collective work
 What we need is what girls elsewhere need: good education, and above all, not to marry whilst 11
And furthermore, I know that together, we can transform the legal, the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights
Thank you
 
 And we're moving in our homes, in our offices, as we shop and travel throughout our cities and around the world
 And luckily for us, we live in a time where we're incredibly good at capturing information about ourselves
 So whether it's through sensors or videos, or apps, we can track our movement with incredibly fine detail
So it turns out one of the places where we have the best data about movement is sports
 So whether it's basketball or baseball, or football or the other football, we're instrumenting our stadiums and our players to track their movements every fraction of a second
 So what we're doing is turning our athletes into -- you probably guessed it -- moving dots
So we've got mountains of moving dots and like most raw data, it's hard to deal with and not that interesting
 But there are things that, for example, basketball coaches want to know
 And a person can't do that, but a machine can
 The problem is a machine can't see the game with the eye of a coach
So, we started simply
 We taught it things like passes, shots and rebounds
 And then we moved on to things slightly more complicated
 Events like post-ups, and pick-and-rolls, and isolations
 And if you don't know them, that's okay
 Most casual players probably do
 Now, we've gotten to a point where today, the machine understands complex events like down screens and wide pins
 Basically things only professionals know
 So we have taught a machine to see with the eyes of a coach
So how have we been able to do this? If I asked a coach to describe something like a pick-and-roll, they would give me a description, and if I encoded that as an algorithm, it would be terrible
 The pick-and-roll happens to be this dance in basketball between four players, two on offense and two on defense
 And here's kind of how it goes
 So there's the guy on offense without the ball the ball and he goes next to the guy guarding the guy with the ball, and he kind of stays there and they both move and stuff happens, and ta-da, it's a pick-and-roll
So that is also an example of a terrible algorithm
 So, if the player who's the interferer -- he's called the screener -- goes close by, but he doesn't stop, it's probably not a pick-and-roll
 Or, if he does go close by and he does stop but they do it under the basket, it's probably not a pick-and-roll
 Or I could be wrong, they could all be pick-and-rolls
 It really depends on the exact timing, the distances, the locations, and that's what makes it hard
 So, luckily, with machine learning, we can go beyond our own ability to describe the things we know
So how does this work? Well, it's by example
 So we go to the machine and say, "Good morning, machine
 Here are some pick-and-rolls, and here are some things that are not
 Please find a way to tell the difference
" And the key to all of this is to find features that enable it to separate
 So if I was going to teach it the difference between an apple and orange, I might say, "Why don't you use color or shape?" And the problem that we're solving is, what are those things? What are the key features that let a computer navigate the world of moving dots? So figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location, distance, timing, velocities -- that's really the key to the science of moving dots, or as we like to call it, spatiotemporal pattern recognition, in academic vernacular
 Because the first thing is, you have to make it sound hard -- because it is
The key thing is, for NBA coaches, it's not that they want to know whether a pick-and-roll happened or not
 It's that they want to know how it happened
 And why is it so important to them? So here's a little insight
 It turns out in modern basketball, this pick-and-roll is perhaps the most important play
 And knowing how to run it, and knowing how to defend it, is basically a key to winning and losing most games
 So it turns out that this dance has a great many variations and identifying the variations is really the thing that matters, and that's why we need this to be really, really good
 There are two offensive and two defensive players, getting ready to do the pick-and-roll dance
 So the guy with ball can either take, or he can reject
 His teammate can either roll or pop
 The guy guarding the ball can either go over or under
 His teammate can either show or play up to touch, or play soft and together they can either switch or blitz and I didn't know most of these things when I started and it would be lovely if everybody moved according to those arrows
 It would make our lives a lot easier, but it turns out movement is very messy
 People wiggle a lot and getting these variations identified with very high accuracy, both in precision and recall, is tough because that's what it takes to get a professional coach to believe in you
 And despite all the difficulties with the right spatiotemporal features we have been able to do that
Coaches trust our ability of our machine to identify these variations
 So not only that, we have given advice that has changed strategies that have helped teams win very important games, and it's very exciting because you have coaches who've been in the league for 30 years that are willing to take advice from a machine
 And it's very exciting, it's much more than the pick-and-roll
 Our computer started out with simple things and learned more and more complex things and now it knows so many things
 Frankly, I don't understand much of what it does, and while it's not that special to be smarter than me, we were wondering, can a machine know more than a coach? Can it know more than person could know? And it turns out the answer is yes
 If I'm standing far away surrounded by defenders, that's generally a bad shot
 But we never knew how good "good" was, or how bad "bad" was quantitatively
 Until now
So what we can do, again, using spatiotemporal features, we looked at every shot
 We can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances? So why is this important? We can take something that was shooting, which was one thing before, and turn it into two things: the quality of the shot and the quality of the shooter
 So here's a bubble chart, because what's TED without a bubble chart?
 The size is the size of the player and the color is the position
 People on the left take difficult shots, on the right, they take easy shots
 People who are good are at the top, bad at the bottom
 So for example, if there was a player who generally made 47 percent of their shots, that's all you knew before
 But today, I can tell you that player takes shots that an average NBA player would make 49 percent of the time, and they are two percent worse
 Machine understanding doesn't just change how we look at players, it changes how we look at the game
So there was this very exciting game a couple of years ago, in the NBA finals
 Miami was down by three, there was 20 seconds left
 They were about to lose the championship
 A gentleman named LeBron James came up and he took a three to tie
 He missed
 His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound, passed it to another teammate named Ray Allen
 He sank a three
 It went into overtime
 They won the game
 They won the championship
 But for you, we recreated that moment at our weekly basketball game about 3 weeks ago
And we recreated the tracking that led to the insights
 This is Chinatown in Los Angeles, a park we play at every week, and that's us recreating the Ray Allen moment and all the tracking that's associated with it
 So, here's the shot
 The only difference is, instead of the professional players, it's us, and instead of a professional announcer, it's me
 So, bear with me
Miami
 Josh catches, puts up a three!
[Calculating shot probability]
[Shot quality]
[Rebound probability]
Won't go!
[Rebound probability]
[Shot quality]
Her three-pointer -- bang! Tie game with five seconds left
Roughly
 That moment had about a nine percent chance of happening in the NBA and we know that and a great many other things
 I'm not going to tell you how many times it took us to make that happen
Okay, I will! It was four
But the important thing about that video and the insights we have for every second of every NBA game -- it's not that
 It's the fact you don't have to be a professional team to track movement
In fact, it doesn't even have to be about sports because we're moving everywhere
 We're moving in our homes, in our offices, as we shop and we travel throughout our cities and around our world
 What will we know? What will we learn? Perhaps, instead of identifying pick-and-rolls, a machine can identify the moment and let me know when my daughter takes her first steps
 Which could literally be happening any second now
Thank you very much
Every group of female friends has the funny one, the one you go to when you need a good cry, the one who tells you to suck it up when you've had a hard day
 And this group was no different
 Except that this was a community of groundbreaking women who came together -- first to become teammates, then friends, and then family -- in the least likely of places: on the Special Operations battlefield
 This was a group of women whose friendship and valor was cemented not only by what they had seen and done at the tip of the spear, but by the fact that they were there at a time when women -- officially, at least -- remained banned from ground combat, and America had no idea they existed
This story begins with Special Operations leaders, some of the most tested men in the United States military, saying, "We need women to help us wage this war
" "America would never kill its way to the end of its wars," it argued
 "Needed more knowledge and more understanding
"
And as everyone knows, if you want to understand what's happening in a community and in a home, you talk to women, whether you're talking about Southern Afghanistan, or Southern California
 But in this case, men could not talk to women, because in a conservative and traditional society like Afghanistan, that would cause grave offense
 So you needed women soldiers out there
 That meant, at this time in the war, that the women who would be recruited to serve alongside Army Rangers and Navy SEALs, would be seeing the kind of combat experienced by less than five percent of the entire United States military
 Less than five percent
 Join Special Operations on the battlefield in Afghanistan
" This is in 2011
 And from Alabama to Alaska, a group of women who had always wanted to do something that mattered alongside the best of the best, and to make a difference for their country, answered that call to serve
And so, the women who came to North Carolina to compete for a spot on these teams which would put women on the Special Operations front lines, landed and found very quickly a community, the likes of which they had never seen
 Full of women who were as fierce and as fit as they were, and as driven to make a difference
 They didn't have to apologize for who they were, and in fact, they could celebrate it
 And what they found when they were there was that all of a sudden, there were lots of people like them
 As one of them said, "It was like you looked around and realized there was more than one giraffe at the zoo
"
Among this team of standouts was Cassie, a young woman who managed to be an ROTC cadet, a sorority sister and a Women's Studies minor, all in one person
 Tristan, a West Point track star, who always ran and road marched with no socks, and had shoes whose smell proved it
  Amber, a Heidi look-alike, who had always wanted to be in the infantry, and when she found out that women couldn't be, she decided to become an intel officer
 She served in Bosnia, and later helped the FBI to bust drug gangs in Pennsylvania
 And then there was Kate, who played high school football all four years, and actually wanted to drop out after the first, to go into the glee club, but when boys told her that girls couldn't play football, she decided to stay for all the little girls who would come after her
For them, biology had shaped part of their destiny, and put, as Cassie once said, "everything noble out of reach for girls
" And yet, here was a chance to serve with the best of the best on a mission that mattered to their country, not despite the fact that they were female, but because of it
This team of women, in many ways, was like women everywhere
 They wore makeup, and in fact, they would bond in the ladies' room over eyeliner and eye pencil
 They would put 50 pounds of weight on their backs, and board the helicopter for an operation, and they would come back and watch a movie called "Bridesmaids
"  They even wore a thing called Spanx, because, as they found very quickly, the uniforms made for men were big where they should be small, and small where they should be big
 So Lane, an Iraq War veteran -- you see her here on my left -- decided she was going to go on Amazon and order a pair of Spanx to her base, so that her pants would fit better when she went out on mission each night
These women would get together over video conference from all around Afghanistan from their various bases, and they would talk about what it was like to be one of the only women doing what they were doing
 They would swap jokes, they would talk about what was working, what wasn't, what they had learned to do well, what they needed to do better
 And they would talk about some of the lighter moments of being women out on the Special Operations front lines, including the Shewee, which was a tool that let you pee like a guy, although it's said to have had only a 40 percent accuracy rate out there
 
These women lived in the "and
" They proved you could be fierce and you could be feminine
 You could wear mascara and body armor
 You could love to climb out of helicopters and you could also love to bake cookies
 Women live in the and every single day, and these women brought that to this mission as well
 On this life and death battlefield they never forgot that being female may have brought them to the front lines, but being a soldier is what would prove themselves there
There was the night Amber went out on mission, and in talking to the women of the house, realized that there was a barricaded shooter lying in wait for the Afghan and American forces who were waiting to enter the home
 Another night it was Tristan who found out that there were pieces that make up explosives all around the house in which they were standing, and that in fact, explosives lay all the way between there and where they were about to head that night
 There was the night another one of their teammates proved herself to a decidedly skeptical team of SEALs, when she found the intel item they were looking for wrapped up in a baby's wet diaper
 And also for the men alongside whom they served
 We talk a lot about how behind every great man is a good woman
 And in this case, next to these women stood men who wanted to see them succeed
 The Army Ranger who trained them had served 12 deployments
 And when they told him that he had to go train girls, he had no idea what to expect
 But at the end of eight days with these women in the summer of 2011, he told his fellow Ranger, "We have just witnessed history
 These may well be our own Tuskegee Airmen
" 
At the heart of this team was the one person who everyone called "the best of us
" She was a petite blonde dynamo, who barely reached five-foot-three
 And she was this wild mix of Martha Stewart, and what we know as G
 Jane
 She was someone who loved to make dinner for her husband, her Kent State ROTC sweetheart who pushed her to be her best, and to trust herself, and to test every limit she could
 She also loved to put 50 pounds of weight on her back and run for miles, and she loved to be a soldier
 She was somebody who had a bread maker in her office in Kandahar, and would bake a batch of raisin bread, and then go to the gym and bust out 25 or 30 pull-ups from a dead hang
 Because she never, ever would talk to you about how good she was, but let her character speak through action
 She was famous for taking the hard right over the easy wrong
 And she was also famous for walking up to a 15-foot rope, climbing it using only her arms, and then shuffling away and apologizing, because she knew she was supposed to use both her arms and her legs, as the Rangers had trained them
 
Some of our heroes return home to tell their stories
 And some of them don't
 And on October 22, 2011, First Lieutenant Ashley White was killed alongside two Rangers, Christopher Horns and Kristoffer Domeij
 Her death threw this program built for the shadows into a very public spotlight
 And at her funeral, the head of Army Special Operations came, and gave a public testimony not just to the courage of Ashley White, but to all her team of sisters
 "Make no mistake about it," he said, "these women are warriors, and they have written a new chapter in what it means to be a female in the United States Army
Ashley's mom is a teacher's aide and a school bus driver, who bakes cookies on the side
 She doesn't remember much about that overwhelming set of days, in which grief -- enormous grief -- mixed with pride
 But she does remember one moment
 A stranger with a child in her hand came up to her and she said, "Mrs
 White, I brought my daughter here today, because I wanted her to know what a hero was
"
It is time to celebrate all the unsung heroines who reach into their guts and find the heart and the grit to keep going and to test every limit
 This very unlikely band of sisters bound forever in life and afterward did indeed become part of history, and they paved the way for so many who would come after them, as much as they stood on the shoulders of those who had come before
 These women showed that warriors come in all shapes and sizes
 And women can be heroes, too
 Thank you so much
 
A few years ago, my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis
 Her wrists, knees and toes swelled up, causing crippling, chronic pain
 She had to file for disability
 Some mornings it was too painful for her to brush her teeth
 But I didn't know how
 I'm not a doctor
So, what I am is a historian of medicine
 So I started to research the history of chronic pain
 Turns out, UCLA has an entire history of pain collection in their archives
 And I found a story -- a fantastic story -- of a man who saved -- rescued -- millions of people from pain; people like my mom
 Yet, I had never heard of him
 His name was John J
 Bonica
 But when our story begins, he was better known as Johnny "Bull" Walker
It was a summer day in 1941
 The circus had just arrived in the tiny town of Brookfield, New York
 Spectators flocked to see the wire-walkers, the tramp clowns -- if they were lucky, the human cannonball
 They also came to see the strongman, Johnny "Bull" Walker, a brawny bully who'd pin you for a dollar
 You know, on that particular day, a voice rang out over the circus P
 system
 They needed a doctor urgently, in the live animal tent
 Something had gone wrong with the lion tamer
 The climax of his act had gone wrong, and his head was stuck inside the lion's mouth
 He was running out of air; the crowd watched in horror as he struggled and then passed out
 When the lion finally did relax its jaws, the lion tamer just slumped to the ground, motionless
 When he came to a few minutes later, he saw a familiar figure hunched over him
 It was Bull Walker
 The strongman had given the lion tamer mouth-to-mouth, and saved his life
Now, the strongman hadn't told anyone, but he was actually a third-year medical student
 He toured with the circus during summers to pay tuition, but kept it a secret to protect his persona
 He was supposed to be a brute, a villain -- not a nerdy do-gooder
 His medical colleagues didn't know his secret, either
" So he didn't tell them about the circus, or about how he wrestled professionally on evenings and weekends
 He used a pseudonym like Bull Walker, or later, the Masked Marvel
 He even kept it a secret that same year, when he was crowned the Light Heavyweight Champion of the world
Over the years, John J
 Bonica lived these parallel lives
 He was a heel; he was a hero
 And he didn’t know it at the time, but over the next five decades, he'd draw on these dueling identities to forge a whole new way to think about pain
 It'd change modern medicine so much so, that decades later, Time magazine would call him pain relief's founding father
In 1942, Bonica graduated medical school and married Emma, his sweetheart, whom he had met at one of his matches years before
 He still wrestled in secret -- he had to
 His internship at New York's St
 Vincent's Hospital paid nothing
 With his championship belt, he wrestled in big-ticket venues, like Madison Square Garden, against big-time opponents, like Everett "The Blonde Bear" Marshall, or three-time world champion, Angelo Savoldi
 One night, The Terrible Turk's big toe scratched a scar like Capone's down the side of his face
 Twice Bonica showed up to the O
 with one eye so bruised, he couldn't see out of it
 But worst of all were his mangled cauliflower ears
 He said they felt like two baseballs on the sides of his head
 Pain just kept accumulating in his life
Next, he watched his wife go into labor at his hospital
 She heaved and pushed, clearly in anguish
 Her obstetrician called out to the intern on duty to give her a few drops of ether to ease her pain
 But the intern was a young guy, just three weeks on the job -- he was jittery, and in applying the ether, irritated Emma's throat
 Bonica, who was watching all this, pushed the intern out of the way, cleared her airway, and saved his wife and his unborn daughter
 Later, he'd even go on to help develop the epidural, for delivering mothers
 But before he could focus on obstetrics, Bonica had to report for basic training
Right around D-Day, Bonica showed up to Madigan Army Medical Center, near Tacoma
 At 7,700 beds, it was one of the largest army hospitals in America
 Bonica was in charge of all pain control there
 He was only 27
 Treating so many patients, Bonica started noticing cases that contradicted everything he had learned
 Pain was supposed to be a kind of alarm bell -- in a good way -- a body's way of signaling an injury, like a broken arm
 But in some cases, like after a patient had a leg amputated, that patient might still complain of pain in that nonexistent leg
 But if the injury had been treated, why would the alarm bell keep ringing? There were other cases in which there was no evidence of an injury whatsoever, and yet, still the patient hurt
Bonica tracked down all the specialists at his hospital -- surgeons, neurologists, psychiatrists, others
 And he tried to get their opinions on his patients
 It took too long, so he started organizing group meetings over lunch
 It would be like a tag team of specialists going up against the patient's pain
 No one had ever focused on pain this way before
After that, he hit the books
 He read every medical textbook he could get his hands on, carefully noting every mention of the word "pain
" Out of the 14,000 pages he read, the word "pain" was on 17 and a half of them
 For the most basic, most common, most frustrating part of being a patient
 Bonica was shocked -- I'm quoting him, he said, "What the hell kind of conclusion can you come to there? The most important thing from the patient's perspective, they don't talk about
So over the next eight years, Bonica would talk about it
 He'd write about it; he'd write those missing pages
 He wrote what would later be known as the Bible of Pain
 In it he proposed new strategies, new treatments using nerve-block injections
 He proposed a new institution, the Pain Clinic, based on those lunchtime meetings
 A desperate plea to doctors to take pain seriously in patients' lives
 He recast the very purpose of medicine
 The goal wasn't to make patients better; it was to make patients feel better
 He pushed his pain agenda for decades, before it finally took hold in the mid-'70s
 Hundreds of pain clinics sprung up all over the world
But as they did -- a tragic twist
 Bonica's years of wrestling caught up to him
 Still in his mid-50s, he suffered severe osteoarthritis
 Over the next 20 years he'd have 22 surgeries, including four spine operations, and hip replacement after hip replacement
 He needed aluminum crutches to walk
 His friends and former students became his doctors
 One recalled that he probably had more nerve-block injections than anyone else on the planet
 Already a workaholic, he worked even more -- 15- to 18-hour days
 Healing others became more than just his job, it was his own most effective form of relief
 "If I wasn't as busy as I am," he told a reporter at the time, "I would be a completely disabled guy
"
 They drove past palm trees and pulled up to an old mansion, with giant silver howitzer cannons hidden in the garage
 Decades earlier, Bonica had watched them, clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles, doing the act they pioneered -- the Human Cannonball
 That generation is all dead now, including Bonica, so there's no way to know exactly what they said that day
 Maybe Bonica gave them medical advice
Bonica saw pain close up
 He felt it
 He lived it
 Out of that empathy, he spun a whole new field, played a major role in getting medicine to acknowledge pain in and of itself
In that same oral history, Bonica claimed that pain is the most complex human experience
 That it involves your past life, your current life, your interactions, your family
 That was definitely true for Bonica
 It's easy for doctors to see my mom as a kind of professional patient, a woman who just spends her days in waiting rooms
 Sometimes I get stuck seeing her that same way
 Before they got swollen and arthritic, my mom's fingers clacked away in the hospital H
R
 They folded samosas for our entire mosque
 When I was a kid, they cut my hair, wiped my nose, tied my shoes
As a matter of fact, I was trying to think about my career since I left the White House, and the best example I have is a cartoon in The New Yorker a couple of years ago
 This little boy is looking up at his father, and he says, "Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be a former president
Well, I have had a great blessing as a former president, because I have had an access that very few other people in the world have ever had to get to know so many people around this whole universe
 And a lot of times, when we go into a country, we not only the meet the king or the president, but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa
So our overall commitment at the Carter Center is to promote human rights, and knowing the world as I do, I can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on Earth is, strangely, not addressed quite often, is the abuse of women and girls
There are a couple of reasons for this that I'll mention to begin with
 First of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures, holy scriptures, in the Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, Quran and so forth, and these have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques
 And they interpret these rules to make sure that women are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God
This is a very serious problem
 It's ordinarily not addressed
 A number of years ago, in the year 2000, I had been a Baptist, a Southern Baptist for 70 years -- I tell you, I still teach Sunday school every Sunday; I'll be teaching this Sunday as well -- but the Southern Baptist Convention in the year 2000 decided that women should play a secondary position, a subservient position to men
 So they issued an edict, in effect, that prevents women from being priests, pastors, deacons in the church, or chaplains in the military, and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary, they cannot teach if a boy is in the room, because you can find verses in the Bible, there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible, that say that a woman shouldn't teach a man, and so forth
 But the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position
The other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence, and that is increasing tremendously around the world
 In the United States of America, for instance, we have had an enormous increase in abuse of poor people, mostly black people and minorities, by putting them in prison
 Nowadays, 7
3 people per 1,000 are in prison
 That's a sevenfold increase
 And since I left the White House, there's been an 800 percent increase in the number of women who are black who are in prison
 We also have [one of the only countries] on Earth that still has the death penalty that is a developed country
 And we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty
 We're in California now, and I figured out the other day that California has spent four billion dollars in convicting 13 people for the death penalty
 If you add that up, that's 307 million dollars it costs California to send a person to be executed
  So the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase in abuse of women
Let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most, and I'll be fairly brief, because I have a limited amount of time, as you know
One is genital mutilation
 Genital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women, but in some countries, many countries, when a child is born that's a girl, very soon in her life, her genitals are completely cut away by a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and, in a non-sterilized way, they remove the exterior parts of a woman's genitalia
 And sometimes, in more extreme cases but not very rare cases, they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate
 And then later, when she gets married, the same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up so she can have sex
 In Egypt, for instance, 91 percent of all the females that live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way
 In some countries, it's more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity
 This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries
 And this is done by members of her own family, so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings so-called disgrace to the family
 An analysis was done in Egypt not so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that 75 percent of these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father, the uncle or the brother, but 25 percent of the murders are conducted by women
Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women particularly is slavery, or human trafficking it's called nowadays
5 million people sold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in the 19th century and the 18th century
 There are 30 million people now living in slavery
 In the United States right this moment, 60,000 people are living in human bondage, or slavery
 Atlanta, Georgia, where the Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University, they have between 200 and 300 women, people sold into slavery every month
 It's the number one place in the nation because of that
 Atlanta has the busiest airport in the world, and they also have a lot of passengers that come from the Southern Hemisphere
 A white-skinned girl brings several times more than that, and the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now can earn about $35,000 per slave
 The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia
 So this is another very serious problem, and the basic problem is prostitution, because there's not a whorehouse in America that's not known by the local officials, the local policemen, or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth
And this leads to one of the worst problems, and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world
Sweden has got a good approach to it
 About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden decided to change the law, and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery, but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted, and --  -- prostitution has gone down
 In the United States, we take just the opposite position
 For every male arrested for illegal sex trade, 25 women are arrested in the United States of America
 Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden, France, and other countries are moving now towards this so-called Swedish model
 That's another thing that can be done
We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire: our military and our great university system
 In the military, they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place
 The last report I got, there were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military -- 26,000
 Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent, are actually prosecuted, and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization -- a ship like my submarine, or a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines -- the commanding officer has the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not, and of course, the last thing they want is for anybody to know that under their command, sexual assaults are taking place, so they do not do it
 That law needs to be changed
About one out of four girls who enter American universities will be sexually assaulted before she graduates, and this is now getting a lot of publicity, partially because of my book, but other things, and so 89 universities in America are now condemned by the Department of Education under Title IX because the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault
 The Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes on a college campus take place by serial rapists, because outside of the university system, if they rape somebody, they'll be prosecuted, but when they get on a university campus, they can rape with impunity
 They're not prosecuted
Another thing that's very serious about the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work, as you know
  And this is sometimes misinterpreted, but for full-time employment, a woman in the United States now gets 23 percent less than a man
 When I became president, the difference was 39 percent
 So we've made some progress, partially because I was president and so forth --   -- but in the last 15 years, there's been no progress made, so it's been just about 23 or 24 percent difference for the last 15 years
 If you take the Fortune 500 companies, 23 of them have women CEOs, out of 500, and those CEOs, I need not tell you, make less on an average than the other CEOs
 Well, that's what goes on in our country
Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike nation on Earth
 We have been to war with about 25 different countries since the Second World War
 Sometimes, we've had soldiers on the ground fighting
 The other times, we've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people
 Other times, of course, now, we have drones that attack people and so forth
 We've been at war with 25 different countries or more since the Second World War
 There was four years, I won't say which ones, where we didn't --  -- we didn't drop a bomb, we didn't launch a missile, we didn't fire a bullet
 But anyway, those kinds of things, the resort to violence and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures are what causes, are the basic causes, of abuse of women and girls
There's one more basic cause that I need not mention, and that is that in general, men don't give a damn
 The average man that might say, I'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy, and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child, when separate but equal had existed
 Racial discrimination, legally, had existed for 100 years, from 1865 at the end of the War Between the States, the Civil War, all the way up to the 1960s, when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights
 Even though they say, "I'm against discrimination against girls and women," they enjoy a privileged position
 And it's very difficult to get the majority of men who control the university system, the majority of men that control the military system, the majority of men that control the governments of the world, and the majority of men that control the great religions
So what is the basic thing that we need to do today? I would say the best thing that we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one, and where you come from, Europe and so forth, who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act, need to take the responsibility on yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination against girls and women all over the world
 The average woman in Egypt doesn't have much to say about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth
 I didn't even go down to detail about that
 But I hope that out of this conference, that every woman here will get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth and in the future job market, need to protect your daughters and your granddaughters
I have 12 grandchildren, four children, and 10 great-grandchildren, and I think often about them and about the plight that they will face in America, not only if they lived in Egypt or a foreign country, in having equal rights, and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women and girls around the world and protect their human rights
 Thank you very much
 
 The challenge, so often, is hanging on to that as we grow up
I will never forget the excitement as we closed the coast
 I will never forget the feeling of adventure as I climbed on board the boat and stared into her tiny cabin for the first time
 But the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom, the feeling that I felt when we hoisted her sails
 As a four-year-old child, it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine
So I did what I could in my life to get closer to that dream
 Age 10, it was saving my school dinner money change
 Every day I would pile up the change on the top of my money box, and when that pile reached a pound, I would drop it in and cross off one of the 100 squares I'd drawn on a piece of paper
 I read every book I could on sailing, and then eventually, having been told by my school I wasn't clever enough to be a vet, left school age 17 to begin my apprenticeship in sailing
So imagine how it felt just four years later to be sitting in a boardroom in front of someone who I knew could make that dream come true
 I felt like my life depended on that moment, and incredibly, he said yes
 And I could barely contain my excitement as I sat in that first design meeting designing a boat on which I was going to sail solo nonstop around the world
 From that first meeting to the finish line of the race, it was everything I'd ever imagined
 We missed an iceberg by 20 feet
 Nine times, I climbed to the top of her 90-foot mast
 We were blown on our side in the Southern Ocean
 But the sunsets, the wildlife, and the remoteness were absolutely breathtaking
 After three months at sea, age just 24, I finished in second position
 I'd loved it, so much so that within six months I decided to go around the world again, but this time not in a race: to try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world
 Now for this, I needed a different craft: bigger, wider, faster, more powerful
 Just to give that boat some scale, I could climb inside her mast all the way to the top
 Seventy-five foot long, 60 foot wide
 I affectionately called her Moby
 She was a multihull
 When we built her, no one had ever made it solo nonstop around the world in one, though many had tried, but whilst we built her, a Frenchman took a boat 25 percent bigger than her and not only did he make it, but he took the record from 93 days right down to 72
And these boats were exciting to sail
 This was a training sail off the French coast
 Five seconds is all it took from everything being fine to our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater, and that five seconds goes quickly
 Just see how far below those guys the sea is
 Imagine that alone in the Southern Ocean plunged into icy water, thousands of miles away from land
It was Christmas Day
 I was forging into the Southern Ocean underneath Australia
 The conditions were horrendous
 I was approaching a part in the ocean which was 2,000 miles away from the nearest town
 The nearest land was Antarctica, and the nearest people would be those manning the European Space Station above me
  You really are in the middle of nowhere
 If you need help, and you're still alive, it takes four days for a ship to get to you and then four days for that ship to get you back to port
 No helicopter can reach you out there, and no plane can land
 We are forging ahead of a huge storm
 Within it, there was 80 knots of wind, which was far too much wind for the boat and I to cope with
 The waves were already 40 to 50 feet high, and the spray from the breaking crests was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard
 If we didn't sail fast enough, we'd be engulfed by that storm, and either capsized or smashed to pieces
 We were quite literally hanging on for our lives and doing so on a knife edge
The speed I so desperately needed brought with it danger
 We all know what it's like driving a car 20 miles an hour, 30, 40
 It's not too stressful
 We can concentrate
 We can turn on the radio
 Take that 50, 60, 70, accelerate through to 80, 90, 100 miles an hour
 Now you have white knuckles and you're gripping the steering wheel
 Now take that car off road at night and remove the windscreen wipers, the windscreen, the headlights and the brakes
 That's what it's like in the Southern Ocean
   You could imagine it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation, even as a passenger
 But you're not a passenger
 You're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in, and you have to make every single decision on board
 I was absolutely exhausted, physically and mentally
 The mainsail weighed three times my body weight, and after each change, I would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat with this freezing Southern Ocean air burning the back of my throat
But out there, those lowest of the lows are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs
 A few days later, we came out of the back of the low
 Against all odds, we'd been able to drive ahead of the record within that depression
 The sky cleared, the rain stopped, and our heartbeat, the monstrous seas around us were transformed into the most beautiful moonlit mountains
It's hard to explain, but you enter a different mode when you head out there
 Your boat is your entire world, and what you take with you when you leave is all you have
 That's what we do, and when we leave we manage it down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food
 No experience in my life could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word "finite
 There is no more
And never in my life had I ever translated that definition of finite that I'd felt on board to anything outside of sailing until I stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record
Suddenly I connected the dots
 Our global economy is no different
 It's entirely dependent on finite materials we only have once in the history of humanity
I chose the first
 I put it to one side and I began a new journey of learning, speaking to chief executives, experts, scientists, economists to try to understand just how our global economy works
 And my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places
This photo was taken in the burner of a coal-fired power station
 My great-grandfather was a coal miner, and he spent 50 years of his life underground
 This is a photo of him, and when you see that photo, you see someone from another era
 No one wears trousers with a waistband quite that high in this day and age
  But yet, that's me with my great-grandfather, and by the way, they are not his real ears
 
We were close
 I remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining stories
 He talked of the camaraderie underground, and the fact that the miners used to save the crusts of their sandwiches to give to the ponies they worked with underground
 It was like it was yesterday
 And on my journey of learning, I went to the World Coal Association website, and there in the middle of the homepage, it said, "We have about 118 years of coal left
" And I thought to myself, well, that's well outside my lifetime, and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil
 But I did the math, and I realized that my great-grandfather had been born exactly 118 years before that year, and I sat on his knee until I was 11 years old, and I realized it's nothing in time, nor in history
 And it made me make a decision I never thought I would make: to leave the sport of solo sailing behind me and focus on the greatest challenge I'd ever come across: the future of our global economy
And I quickly realized it wasn't just about energy
 It was also materials
 These figures couldn't be exact, but we knew those materials were finite
 We only have them once
 With more people in the world with more stuff, we've effectively seen 100 years of price declines in those basic commodities erased in just 10 years
 And this affects all of us
 It's brought huge volatility in prices, so much so that in 2011, your average European car manufacturer saw a raw material price increase of 500 million Euros, wiping away half their operating profits through something they have absolutely no control over
And the more I learned, the more I started to change my own life
 It felt like actually doing less was what we had to do
 But it sat uneasy with me
 It didn't feel right
 It felt like we were buying ourselves time
 We were eking things out a bit longer
 Even if everybody changed, it wouldn't solve the problem
 It wouldn't fix the system
 It was vital in the transition, but what fascinated me was, in the transition to what? What could actually work?
It struck me that the system itself, the framework within which we live, is fundamentally flawed, and I realized ultimately that our operating system, the way our economy functions, the way our economy's been built, is a system in itself
 At sea, I had to understand complex systems
 I had to take multiple inputs, I had to process them, and I had to understand the system to win
 I had to make sense of it
 And as I looked at our global economy, I realized it too is that system, but it's a system that effectively can't run in the long term
 It's an economy that fundamentally can't run in the long term, and if we know that we have finite materials, why would we build an economy that would effectively use things up, that would create waste? Life itself has existed for billions of years and has continually adapted to use materials effectively
 It's a complex system, but within it, there is no waste
 Everything is metabolized
 It's not a linear economy at all, but circular
And I felt like the child in the garden
 For the first time on this new journey, I could see exactly where we were headed
 I was excited
 We knew exactly where we were headed
 We just had to work out how to get there, and it was exactly with this in mind that we created the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in September 2010
Many schools of thought fed our thinking and pointed to this model: industrial symbiosis, performance economy, sharing economy, biomimicry, and of course, cradle-to-cradle design
 Materials would be defined as either technical or biological, waste would be designed out entirely, and we would have a system that could function absolutely in the long term
So what could this economy look like? Maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings, but we'd pay for the service of light, and the manufacturers would recover the materials and change the light fittings when we had more efficient products
 What if packaging was so nontoxic it could dissolve in water and we could ultimately drink it? It would never become waste
 What if engines were re-manufacturable, and we could recover the component materials and significantly reduce energy demand
 What if we could recover components from circuit boards, reutilize them, and then fundamentally recover the materials within them through a second stage? What if we could collect food waste, human waste? What if we could turn that into fertilizer, heat, energy, ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems and rebuilding natural capital? And cars -- what we want is to move around
 We don't need to own the materials within them
 Could cars become a service and provide us with mobility in the future? All of this sounds amazing, but these aren't just ideas, they're real today, and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy
 What lies before us is to expand them and scale them up
 We thought you might want to work with the best analysts and ask them the question, "Can the circular economy decouple growth from resource constraints? Is the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital? Could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use?" Yes was the answer to the decoupling, but also yes, we could replace current fertilizer use by a staggering 2
7 times
 But what inspired me most about the circular economy was its ability to inspire young people
 They can use their creativity and knowledge to rebuild the entire system, and it's there for the taking right now, and the faster we do this, the better
So could we achieve this in their lifetimes? Is it actually possible? I believe yes
 When you look at the lifetime of my great-grandfather, anything's possible
 When he was born, there were only 25 cars in the world; they had only just been invented
 When he was 14, we flew for the first time in history
 Now there are 100,000 charter flights every single day
 When he was 45, we built the first computer
 Ten years before he died, we built the first mobile phone
 It wasn't that mobile, to be fair, but now it really is, and as my great-grandfather left this Earth, the Internet arrived
 Now we can do anything, but more importantly, now we have a plan
So in 1885, Karl Benz invented the automobile
 For the last 130 years, we've been working around that least reliable part of the car, the driver
 We've made the car stronger
 We've added seat belts, we've added air bags, and in the last decade, we've actually started trying to make the car smarter to fix that bug, the driver
Now, today I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the difference between patching around the problem with driver assistance systems and actually having fully self-driving cars and what they can do for the world
 I'm also going to talk to you a little bit about our car and allow you to see how it sees the world and how it reacts and what it does, but first I'm going to talk a little bit about the problem
 And it's a big problem: 1
2 million people are killed on the world's roads every year
 In America alone, 33,000 people are killed each year
 It's kind of unbelievable
 Cars are sold to us like this, but really, this is what driving's like
 In America, between 1990 and 2010, the vehicle miles traveled increased by 38 percent
 We grew by six percent of roads, so it's not in your brains
 Traffic really is substantially worse than it was not very long ago
And all of this has a very human cost
 You take that six billion minutes and you divide it by the average life expectancy of a person, that turns out to be 162 lifetimes spent every day, wasted, just getting from A to B
 It's unbelievable
 So this is Steve
 He doesn't have that same freedom that you and I have to get around
 We should do something about that
Now, conventional wisdom would say that we'll just take these driver assistance systems and we'll kind of push them and incrementally improve them, and over time, they'll turn into self-driving cars
 We actually need to do something a little different
 And so I'm going to talk to you about three different ways that self-driving systems are different than driver assistance systems
 And I'm going to start with some of our own experience
So back in 2013, we had the first test of a self-driving car where we let regular people use it
 Well, almost regular -- they were 100 Googlers, but they weren't working on the project
 And we gave them the car and we allowed them to use it in their daily lives
 But unlike a real self-driving car, this one had a big asterisk with it: They had to pay attention, because this was an experimental vehicle
 We tested it a lot, but it could still fail
 And so we gave them two hours of training, we put them in the car, we let them use it, and what we heard back was something awesome, as someone trying to bring a product into the world
 Every one of them told us they loved it
 In fact, we had a Porsche driver who came in and told us on the first day, "This is completely stupid
 What are we thinking?" But at the end of it, he said, "Not only should I have it, everyone else should have it, because people are terrible drivers
" So this was music to our ears, but then we started to look at what the people inside the car were doing, and this was eye-opening
 Now, my favorite story is this gentleman who looks down at his phone and realizes the battery is low, so he turns around like this in the car and digs around in his backpack, pulls out his laptop, puts it on the seat, goes in the back again, digs around, pulls out the charging cable for his phone, futzes around, puts it into the laptop, puts it on the phone
 Sure enough, the phone is charging
 Right? Unbelievable
 So we thought about this and we said, it's kind of obvious, right? The better the technology gets, the less reliable the driver is going to get
 So by just making the cars incrementally smarter, we're probably not going to see the wins we really need
Let me talk about something a little technical for a moment here
 So we're looking at this graph, and along the bottom is how often does the car apply the brakes when it shouldn't
 You can ignore most of that axis, because if you're driving around town, and the car starts stopping randomly, you're never going to buy that car
 And the vertical axis is how often the car is going to apply the brakes when it's supposed to to help you avoid an accident
 Now, if we look at the bottom left corner here, this is your classic car
 It doesn't apply the brakes for you, it doesn't do anything goofy, but it also doesn't get you out of an accident
 But we'll pick some place along the curve here, and maybe it avoids half of accidents that the human driver misses, and that's amazing, right? We just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two
 There are now 17,000 less people dying every year in America
But if we want a self-driving car, we need a technology curve that looks like this
 We're going to have to put more sensors in the vehicle, and we'll pick some operating point up here where it basically never gets into a crash
 They'll happen, but very low frequency
 Now you and I could look at this and we could argue about whether it's incremental, and I could say something like "80-20 rule," and it's really hard to move up to that new curve
 And so this green dot up here is a driver assistance system
 It turns out that human drivers make mistakes that lead to traffic accidents about once every 100,000 miles in America
 In contrast, a self-driving system is probably making decisions about 10 times per second, so order of magnitude, that's about 1,000 times per mile
 So if you compare the distance between these two, it's about 10 to the eighth, right? Eight orders of magnitude
 It doesn't matter how hard I train, I'm never actually going to get there
 So there's a pretty big gap there
 So this pedestrian here might be stepping into the road, might not be
 I can't tell, nor can any of our algorithms, but in the case of a driver assistance system, that means it can't take action, because again, if it presses the brakes unexpectedly, that's completely unacceptable
 Whereas a self-driving system can look at that pedestrian and say, I don't know what they're about to do, slow down, take a better look, and then react appropriately after that
So it can be much safer than a driver assistance system can ever be
 So that's enough about the differences between the two
 So here, all the purple boxes you can see are other vehicles on the road, and the red thing on the side over there is a cyclist, and up in the distance, if you look really closely, you can see some cones
 Then we know where the car is in the moment, but we have to do better than that: we have to predict what's going to happen
 So here the pickup truck in top right is about to make a left lane change because the road in front of it is closed, so it needs to get out of the way
 Knowing that one pickup truck is great, but we really need to know what everybody's thinking, so it becomes quite a complicated problem
 And then given that, we can figure out how the car should respond in the moment, so what trajectory it should follow, how quickly it should slow down or speed up
 And then that all turns into just following a path: turning the steering wheel left or right, pressing the brake or gas
 It's really just two numbers at the end of the day
 So how hard can it really be?
Back when we started in 2009, this is what our system looked like
 So you can see our car in the middle and the other boxes on the road, driving down the highway
 The car needs to understand where it is and roughly where the other vehicles are
 It's really a geometric understanding of the world
 Once we started driving on neighborhood and city streets, the problem becomes a whole new level of difficulty
 You see pedestrians crossing in front of us, cars crossing in front of us, going every which way, the traffic lights, crosswalks
 And then once you have that problem solved, the vehicle has to be able to deal with construction
 It has to deal with other people moving through that construction zone as well
 Similarly, the orange box on the side here, it's a school bus, and we have to treat that differently as well
 And when a police officer stood in the road, our vehicle should understand that this means stop, and when they signal to go, we should continue
Now, the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles
 The first, most crude model of this is when one vehicle sees a construction zone, having another know about it so it can be in the correct lane to avoid some of the difficulty
 But we actually have a much deeper understanding of this
 We could take all of the data that the cars have seen over time, the hundreds of thousands of pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles that have been out there and understand what they look like and use that to infer what other vehicles should look like and other pedestrians should look like
 And then, even more importantly, we could take from that a model of how we expect them to move through the world
 So here the yellow box is a pedestrian crossing in front of us
 Here the blue box is a cyclist and we anticipate that they're going to nudge out and around the car to the right
 Here there's a cyclist coming down the road and we know they're going to continue to drive down the shape of the road
 Here somebody makes a right turn, and in a moment here, somebody's going to make a U-turn in front of us, and we can anticipate that behavior and respond safely
Now, that's all well and good for things that we've seen, but of course, you encounter lots of things that you haven't seen in the world before
 And so just a couple of months ago, our vehicles were driving through Mountain View, and this is what we encountered
 This is a woman in an electric wheelchair chasing a duck in circles on the road
  Now it turns out, there is nowhere in the DMV handbook that tells you how to deal with that, but our vehicles were able to encounter that, slow down, and drive safely
 Here we're dealing with a cyclist that you would never expect to see anywhere other than Mountain View
 And of course, we have to deal with drivers, even the very small ones
 Watch to the right as someone jumps out of this truck at us
 And now, watch the left as the car with the green box decides he needs to make a right turn at the last possible moment
 Here, as we make a lane change, the car to our left decides it wants to as well
 And here, we watch a car blow through a red light and yield to it
 And similarly, here, a cyclist blowing through that light as well
 And of course, the vehicle responds safely
 And of course, we have people who do I don't know what sometimes on the road, like this guy pulling out between two self-driving cars
 You have to ask, "What are you thinking?" 
Now, I just fire-hosed you with a lot of stuff there, so I'm going to break one of these down pretty quickly
 So what we're looking at is the scene with the cyclist again, and you might notice in the bottom, we can't actually see the cyclist yet, but the car can: it's that little blue box up there, and that comes from the laser data
 And that's not actually really easy to understand, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn that laser data and look at it, and if you're really good at looking at laser data, you can see a few dots on the curve there, right there, and that blue box is that cyclist
 Now as our light is red, the cyclist's light has turned yellow already, and if you squint, you can see that in the imagery
 But the cyclist, we see, is going to proceed through the intersection
 Our light has now turned green, his is solidly red, and we now anticipate that this bike is going to come all the way across
Now, as you can see, we've made some pretty exciting progress, and at this point we're pretty convinced this technology is going to come to market
 We do three million miles of testing in our simulators every single day, so you can imagine the experience that our vehicles have
 We are looking forward to having this technology on the road, and we think the right path is to go through the self-driving rather than driver assistance approach because the urgency is so large
 In the time I have given this talk today, 34 people have died on America's roads
How soon can we bring it out? Well, it's hard to say because it's a really complicated problem, but these are my two boys
 My oldest son is 11, and that means in four and a half years, he's going to be able to get his driver's license
 My team and I are committed to making sure that doesn't happen
Thank you
 Chris, I've got a question for you
 Sure
 So certainly, the mind of your cars is pretty mind-boggling
 On this debate between driver-assisted and fully driverless -- I mean, there's a real debate going on out there right now
 So some of the companies, for example, Tesla, are going the driver-assisted route
 No, that's exactly right, and it's not to say that the driver assistance systems aren't going to be incredibly valuable
 They can save a lot of lives in the interim, but to see the transformative opportunity to help someone like Steve get around, to really get to the end case in safety, to have the opportunity to change our cities and move parking out and get rid of these urban craters we call parking lots, it's the only way to go
 CU: Thank you
 
 His name was Joe McKenna
 He was a young husband and a semi-pro basketball player and a fireman in New York City
 Family history says he loved being a fireman, and so in 1938, on one of his days off, he elected to hang out at the firehouse
 To make himself useful that day, he started polishing all the brass, the railings on the fire truck, the fittings on the walls, and one of the fire hose nozzles, a giant, heavy piece of metal, toppled off a shelf and hit him
 A few days later, his shoulder started to hurt
 Two days after that, he spiked a fever
 The nurses there recognized right away that he had an infection, what at the time they would have called "blood poisoning," and though they probably didn't say it, they would have known right away that there was nothing they could do
 The first test of penicillin, the first antibiotic, was three years in the future
 People who got infections either recovered, if they were lucky, or they died
 His condition grew so desperate that the people from his firehouse lined up to give him transfusions hoping to dilute the infection surging through his blood
 He was 30 years old
 Most people didn't die of cancer or heart disease, the lifestyle diseases that afflict us in the West today
 They didn't die of those diseases because they didn't live long enough to develop them
 They died of injuries -- being gored by an ox, shot on a battlefield, crushed in one of the new factories of the Industrial Revolution -- and most of the time from infection, which finished what those injuries began
All of that changed when antibiotics arrived
 Suddenly, infections that had been a death sentence became something you recovered from in days
 It seemed like a miracle, and ever since, we have been living inside the golden epoch of the miracle drugs
And now, we are coming to an end of it
 My great uncle died in the last days of the pre-antibiotic era
 We stand today on the threshold of the post-antibiotic era, in the earliest days of a time when simple infections such as the one Joe had will kill people once again
In fact, they already are
 Briefly, it works like this
 Other bacteria, to protect themselves, evolve defenses against that chemical attack
 When we first made antibiotics, we took those compounds into the lab and made our own versions of them, and bacteria responded to our attack the way they always had
Here is what happened next: Penicillin was distributed in 1943, and widespread penicillin resistance arrived by 1945
 Vancomycin arrived in 1972, vancomycin resistance in 1988
 Imipenem in 1985, and resistance to in 1998
 Daptomycin, one of the most recent drugs, in 2003, and resistance to it just a year later in 2004
For 70 years, we played a game of leapfrog -- our drug and their resistance, and then another drug, and then resistance again -- and now the game is ending
This is what that looks like
 In 2000, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, identified a single case in a hospital in North Carolina of an infection resistant to all but two drugs
 Today, that infection, known as KPC, has spread to every state but three, and to South America, Europe and the Middle East
 In 2008, doctors in Sweden diagnosed a man from India with a different infection resistant to all but one drug that time
It would be natural to hope that these infections are extraordinary cases, but in fact, in the United States and Europe, 50,000 people a year die of infections which no drugs can help
 A project chartered by the British government known as the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance estimates that the worldwide toll right now is 700,000 deaths a year
That is a lot of deaths, and yet, the chances are good that you don't feel at risk, that you imagine these people were hospital patients in intensive care units or nursing home residents near the ends of their lives, people whose infections are remote from us, in situations we can't identify with
If we lost antibiotics, here's what else we'd lose: First, any protection for people with weakened immune systems -- cancer patients, AIDS patients, transplant recipients, premature babies
Next, any treatment that installs foreign objects in the body: stents for stroke, pumps for diabetes, dialysis, joint replacements
 Many operations are preceded by prophylactic doses of antibiotics
 Without that protection, we'd lose the ability to open the hidden spaces of the body
 So no heart operations, no prostate biopsies, no Cesarean sections
 We'd have to learn to fear infections that now seem minor
 Skin infections led to amputations
 Giving birth killed, in the cleanest hospitals, almost one woman out of every 100
 Pneumonia took three children out of every 10
More than anything else, we'd lose the confident way we live our everyday lives
 If you knew that any injury could kill you, would you ride a motorcycle, bomb down a ski slope, climb a ladder to hang your Christmas lights, let your kid slide into home plate? After all, the first person to receive penicillin, a British policeman named Albert Alexander, who was so ravaged by infection that his scalp oozed pus and doctors had to take out an eye, was infected by doing something very simple
 He walked into his garden and scratched his face on a thorn
 Resistance is an inevitable biological process, but we bear the responsibility for accelerating it
 We did this by squandering antibiotics with a heedlessness that now seems shocking
 In much of the developing world, most antibiotics still are
 And that's just in healthcare
 In the United States, possibly 80 percent of the antibiotics sold every year go to farm animals, not to humans, creating resistant bacteria that move off the farm in water, in dust, in the meat the animals become
 Aquaculture depends on antibiotics too, particularly in Asia, and fruit growing relies on antibiotics to protect apples, pears, citrus, against disease
 And because bacteria can pass their DNA to each other like a traveler handing off a suitcase at an airport, once we have encouraged that resistance into existence, there is no knowing where it will spread
This was predictable
 In fact, it was predicted by Alexander Fleming, the man who discovered penicillin
 He was given the Nobel Prize in 1945 in recognition, and in an interview shortly after, this is what he said:
"The thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of a man who succumbs to infection with a pencillin-resistant organism
" He added, "I hope this evil can be averted
"
 It takes pharmaceutical chemistry 10 years to derive a new drug
 There has never yet been a drug they could not defeat
 We could build systems to harvest data to tell us automatically and specifically how antibiotics are being used
 We could build gatekeeping into drug order systems so that every prescription gets a second look
 We could require agriculture to give up antibiotic use
Those are the tech solutions
 They probably aren't enough either, unless we help
 Antibiotic resistance is a habit
 We all know how hard it is to change a habit
 But as a society, we've done that in the past
 People used to toss litter into the streets, used to not wear seatbelts, used to smoke inside public buildings
 We don't do those things anymore
 We don't trash the environment or court devastating accidents or expose others to the possibility of cancer, because we decided those things were expensive, destructive, not in our best interest
 We changed social norms
 We could change social norms around antibiotic use too
 We could take those kinds of steps for antibiotic use too
 We could forgo giving an antibiotic if we're not sure it's the right one
 We could stop insisting on a prescription for our kid's ear infection before we're sure what caused it
 We could ask every restaurant, every supermarket, where their meat comes from
 We could promise each other never again to buy chicken or shrimp or fruit raised with routine antibiotic use, and if we did those things, we could slow down the arrival of the post-antibiotic world
But we have to do it soon
 Penicillin began the antibiotic era in 1943
 In just 70 years, we walked ourselves up to the edge of disaster
Blah blah blah blah blah
 Blah blah blah blah, blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah
 Blah blah blah, blah
So what the hell was that? Well, you don't know because you couldn't understand it
 It wasn't clear
 But hopefully, it was said with enough conviction that it was at least alluringly mysterious
Clarity or mystery? I'm balancing these two things in my daily work as a graphic designer, as well as my daily life as a New Yorker every day, and there are two elements that absolutely fascinate me
Here's an example
 Now, how many people know what this is? Okay
 Now how many people know what this is? Okay
 Thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius Charles M
 Schulz, we now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves create an entire emotional life, one that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans for over 50 years
 This is actually a cover of a book that I designed about the work of Schulz and his art, which will be coming out this fall, and that is the entire cover
 There is no other typographic information or visual information on the front, and the name of the book is "Only What's Necessary
" So this is sort of symbolic about the decisions I have to make every day about the design that I'm perceiving, and the design I'm creating
So clarity
 It's blunt
 It's honest
 We ask ourselves this
 ["When should you be clear?"]
Now, something like this, whether we can read it or not, needs to be really, really clear
 So when these meters started showing up a couple of years ago on street corners, I was thrilled, because now I finally knew how many seconds I had to get across the street before I got run over by a car
 Six? I can do that
So let's look at the yin to the clarity yang, and that is mystery
 Mystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition
 Mystery demands to be decoded, and when it's done right, we really, really want to
 ["When should you be mysterious?"] In World War II, the Germans really, really wanted to decode this, and they couldn't
Here's an example of a design that I've done recently for a novel by Haruki Murakami, who I've done design work for for over 20 years now, and this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends who all of a sudden, after their freshman year of college, completely cut him off with no explanation, and he is devastated
 And the friends' names each have a connotation in Japanese to a color
 So there's Mr
 Red, there's Mr
 Blue, there's Ms
 White, and Ms
 Black
 Tsukuru Tazaki, his name does not correspond to a color, so his nickname is Colorless, and as he's looking back on their friendship, he recalls that they were like five fingers on a hand
 So I created this sort of abstract representation of this, but there's a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story, and there's more going on underneath the surface of the jacket
 The four fingers are now four train lines in the Tokyo subway system, which has significance within the story
 And then you have the colorless subway line intersecting with each of the other colors, which basically he does later on in the story
 He catches up with each of these people to find out why they treated him the way they did
And so this is the three-dimensional finished product sitting on my desk in my office, and what I was hoping for here is that you'll simply be allured by the mystery of what this looks like, and will want to read it to decode and find out and make more clear why it looks the way it does
["The Visual Vernacular
"]
This is a way to use a more familiar kind of mystery
 What does this mean? This is what it means
 ["Make it look like something else
"] The visual vernacular is the way we are used to seeing a certain thing applied to something else so that we see it in a different way
This is an approach I wanted to take to a book of essays by David Sedaris that had this title at the time
 ["All the Beauty You Will Ever Need"] Now, the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing
 It's not connected to any of the essays in the book
 It came to the author's boyfriend in a dream
 Thank you very much, so --  -- so usually, I am creating a design that is in some way based on the text, but this is all the text there is
 This says, "Hardly anyone knows how much is gained by ignoring the future
" Thank you
  But we can take this visual vernacular and apply it to Mr
 Sedaris, and we are so familiar with how fortune cookie fortunes look that we don't even need the bits of the cookie anymore
 We're just seeing this strange thing and we know we love David Sedaris, and so we're hoping that we're in for a good time
 So he was this skinny little urban guy and GQ magazine would send him down the Colorado River whitewater rafting to see if he would survive
 And then he would write about it, and he felt that he was a fraud and that he was misrepresenting himself
 And so I wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself and then somehow show a reader reacting to it
This led me to graffiti
 I'm fascinated by graffiti
 I think anybody who lives in an urban environment encounters graffiti all the time, and there's all different sorts of it
 This is a picture I took on the Lower East Side of just a transformer box on the sidewalk and it's been tagged like crazy
 Now whether you look at this and think, "Oh, that's a charming urban affectation," or you look at it and say, "That's illegal abuse of property," the one thing I think we can all agree on is that you cannot read it
 Right? There is no clear message here
 There is another kind of graffiti that I find far more interesting, which I call editorial graffiti
 This is a picture I took recently in the subway, and sometimes you see lots of prurient, stupid stuff, but I thought this was interesting, and this is a poster that is saying rah-rah Airbnb, and someone has taken a Magic Marker and has editorialized about what they think about it
 And it got my attention
So I was thinking, how do we apply this to this book? So I get the book by this person, and I start reading it, and I'm thinking, this guy is not who he says he is; he's a fraud
 And I get out a red Magic Marker, and out of frustration just scribble this across the front
 Design done
  And they went for it!  Author liked it, publisher liked it, and that is how the book went out into the world, and it was really fun to see people reading this on the subway and walking around with it and what have you, and they all sort of looked like they were crazy
 
["'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy"] Okay, James Ellroy, amazing crime writer, a good friend, I've worked with him for many years
 He is probably best known as the author of "The Black Dahlia" and "L
A
" His most recent novel was called this, which is a very mysterious name that I'm sure a lot of people know what it means, but a lot of people don't
 And it's a story about a Japanese-American detective in Los Angeles in 1941 investigating a murder
 And then Pearl Harbor happens, and as if his life wasn't difficult enough, now the race relations have really ratcheted up, and then the Japanese-American internment camps are quickly created, and there's lots of tension and horrible stuff as he's still trying to solve this murder
 And so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor just grafted onto Los Angeles
 My editor in chief said, "You know, it's interesting but I think you can do better and I think you can make it simpler
" And so I went back to the drawing board, as I often do
 But also, being alive to my surroundings, I work in a high-rise in Midtown, and every night, before I leave the office, I have to push this button to get out, and the big heavy glass doors open and I can get onto the elevator
 And one night, all of a sudden, I looked at this and I saw it in a way that I hadn't really noticed it before
 Big red circle, danger
 And I thought this was so obvious that it had to have been done a zillion times, and so I did a Google image search, and I couldn't find another book cover that looked quite like this, and so this is really what solved the problem, and graphically it's more interesting and creates a bigger tension between the idea of a certain kind of sunrise coming up over L
A
 and America
["'Gulp' A tour of the human digestive system by Mary Roach
Mary Roach is an amazing writer who takes potentially mundane scientific subjects and makes them not mundane at all; she makes them really fun
 So in this particular case, it's about the human digestive system
 This is a self-portrait
  Every morning I look at myself in the medicine cabinet mirror to see if my tongue is black
 And if it's not, I'm good to go
  I recommend you all do this
 But I also started thinking, here's our introduction
 Right? Into the human digestive system
 But I think what we can all agree on is that actual photographs of human mouths, at least based on this, are off-putting
  So for the cover, then, I had this illustration done which is literally more palatable and reminds us that it's best to approach the digestive system from this end
 This is what I call unuseful mystery
 I go down into the subway -- I take the subway a lot -- and this piece of paper is taped to a girder
 Right? And now I'm thinking, uh-oh, and the train's about to come and I'm trying to figure out what this means, and thanks a lot
 So this is mystery we do not need
 What we need is useful clarity, so just for fun, I redesigned this
  Thank you
 I am still waiting for a call from the MTA
  You know, I'm actually not even using more colors than they use
 They just didn't even bother to make the 4 and the 5 green, those idiots
  So the first thing we see is that there is a service change, and then, in two complete sentences with a beginning, a middle and an end, it tells us what the change is and what's going to be happening
 Call me crazy! 
["Useful mystery"] All right
 Now, here is a piece of mystery that I love: packaging
 This redesign of the Diet Coke can by Turner Duckworth is to me truly a piece of art
 It's a work of art
 But part of what makes it so heartening to me as a designer is that he's taken the visual vernacular of Diet Coke -- the typefaces, the colors, the silver background -- and he's reduced them to their most essential parts, so it's like going back to the Charlie Brown face
 It's like, how can you give them just enough information so they know what it is but giving them the credit for the knowledge that they already have about this thing? It looks great, and you would go into a delicatessen and all of a sudden see that on the shelf, and it's wonderful
 Which makes the next thing -- ["Unuseful clarity"] -- all the more disheartening, at least to me
 So okay, again, going back down into the subway, after this came out, these are pictures that I took
 Times Square subway station: Coca-Cola has bought out the entire thing for advertising
 Ahem
 You're on Coke
"  "You moved to New York with an MBA, one clean suit, and an extremely firm handshake
 You're on Coke
"  These are real!  Not even the support beams were spared, except they switched into Yoda mode
  "Coke you're on
"  ["Excuse me, I'm on WHAT??"] This campaign was a huge misstep
 So thanks a lot
 It was just incredible to me
 
And if there's just one thing that I leave you with from this talk, I hope it's this: Blih blih blih blah
 Blah blah blih blih
 ["'Judge This,' Chip Kidd"] Blih blih blah blah blah
 Blah blah blah
Blah blah
I am failing as a woman, I am failing as a feminist
I have passionate opinions about gender equality, but I worry that to freely accept the label of "feminist," would not be fair to good feminists
I'm a feminist, but I'm a rather bad one
 Oh, so I call myself a Bad Feminist
 Or at least, I wrote an essay, and then I wrote a book called "Bad Feminist," and then in interviews, people started calling me The Bad Feminist
 
So, what started as a bit of an inside joke with myself and a willful provocation, has become a thing
 When I was younger, mostly in my teens and 20s, I had strange ideas about feminists as hairy, angry, man-hating, sex-hating women -- as if those are bad things
  These days, I look at how women are treated the world over, and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable response
But back then, I worried about the tone people used when suggesting I might be a feminist
 The feminist label was an accusation, it was an "F" word, and not a nice one
As I got older, I began to accept that I am, indeed, a feminist, and a proud one
 I hold certain truths to be self-evident: Women are equal to men
 We deserve equal pay for equal work
 We have the right to move through the world as we choose, free from harassment or violence
 We have the right to easy, affordable access to birth control, and reproductive services
 We have the right to make choices about our bodies, free from legislative oversight or evangelical doctrine
 We have the right to respect
There's more
 When we talk about the needs of women, we have to consider the other identities we inhabit
 We are not just women
 Without this kind of inclusion, our feminism is nothing
I hold these truths to be self-evident, but let me be clear: I'm a mess
 I am full of contradictions
 There are many ways in which I'm doing feminism wrong
I have another confession
  Even though the lyrics are degrading to women -- these lyrics offend me to my core -- the classic Yin Yang Twins song "Salt Shaker" -- it is amazing
  "Make it work with your wet t-shirt
 Bitch, you gotta shake it 'til your camel starts to hurt!"  Think about it
 I want no part of any of that
  Pink is my favorite color
 I watch "The Bachelor" and romantic comedies, and I have absurd fantasies about fairy tales coming true
Some of my transgressions are more flagrant
 If a woman chooses to stay home to raise her children, I embrace that choice, too
 Let's deal with that
I reject the mainstream feminism that has historically ignored or deflected the needs of women of color, working-class women, queer women and transgender women, in favor of supporting white, middle- and upper-class straight women
 Listen, if that's good feminism -- I am a very bad feminist
 
 As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure
 We expect them to pose perfectly
 When they disappoint us, we gleefully knock them from the very pedestal we put them on
 Like I said, I am a mess -- consider me knocked off that pedestal before you ever try to put me up there
 
Too many women, particularly groundbreaking women and industry leaders, are afraid to be labeled as feminists
Take, for example, Beyoncé, or as I call her, The Goddess
  She has emerged, in recent years, as a visible feminist
 At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, she performed in front of the word "feminist" 10 feet high
 It was a glorious spectacle to see this pop star openly embracing feminism and letting young women and men know that being a feminist is something to celebrate
 They graded her feminism, instead of simply taking a grown, accomplished woman at her word
  
We demand perfection from feminists, because we are still fighting for so much, we want so much, we need so damn much
We go far beyond reasonable, constructive criticism, to dissecting any given woman's feminism, tearing it apart until there's nothing left
 We do not need to do that
 Bad feminism -- or really, more inclusive feminism -- is a starting point
But what happens next? We go from acknowledging our imperfections to accountability, or walking the walk, and being a little bit brave
 If I listen to degrading music, I am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy to contribute a limitless supply
 These artists are not going to change how they talk about women in their songs until we demand that change by affecting their bottom line
 Certainly, it is difficult
 Why must it be so catchy?  It's hard to make the better choice, and it is so easy to justify a lesser one
I think of my nieces, ages three and four
 They are gorgeous and headstrong, brilliant girls, who are a whole lot of brave
 I want them to thrive in a world where they are valued for the powerful creatures they are
 I think of them, and suddenly, the better choice becomes far easier to make
We can all make better choices
 We can change the channel when a television show treats sexual violence against women like sport, Game of Thrones
 We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women as nothing
 We can spend our box office dollars elsewhere when movies don't treat women as anything more than decorative objects
 We can stop supporting professional sports where the athletes treat their partners like punching bags
 
In other ways, men -- and especially straight white men -- can say, "No, I will not publish with your magazine, or participate in your project, or otherwise work with you, until you include a fair number of women, both as participants and decision makers
 I won't work with you until your publication, or your organization, is more inclusive of all kinds of difference
"
Those of us who are underrepresented and invited to participate in such projects, can also decline to be included until more of us are invited through the glass ceiling, and we are tokens no more
Without these efforts, without taking these stands, our accomplishments are going to mean very little
 We can commit these small acts of bravery and hope that our choices trickle upward to the people in power -- editors, movie and music producers, CEOs, lawmakers -- the people who can make bigger, braver choices to create lasting, meaningful change
We can also boldly claim our feminism -- good, bad, or anywhere in between
 The last line of my book "Bad Feminist" says, "I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all
" This is true for so many reasons, but first and foremost, I say this because once upon a time, my voice was stolen from me, and feminism helped me to get my voice back
There was an incident
 Some boys broke me, when I was so young, I did not know what boys can do to break a girl
 They treated me like I was nothing
 I began to believe I was nothing
 They stole my voice, and in the after, I did not dare to believe that anything I might say could matter
But -- I had writing
 And there, I wrote myself back together
 I read the words of women who showed me I was not nothing
 I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself
 I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond measure
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if I was a little bit brave, another woman might hear me and see me and recognize that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are
In one hand, I hold the power to accomplish anything
 I hope that we can all do the same
